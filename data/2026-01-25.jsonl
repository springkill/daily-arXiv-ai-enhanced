However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation"}

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems."}

This work introduces the first open source framework for automatic recognition of SmartBAN signals in Body Area Networks (BANs). The framework combines a synthetic dataset of simulated signals with real RF acquisitions obtained through Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), enabling both controlled and realistic evaluation. Deep convolutional neural networks based on ResNet encoders and U-Net decoders with attention mechanisms are trained and assessed across diverse propagation conditions. The proposed approach achieves over 90% accuracy on synthetic datasets and demonstrates consistent performance on real over-the-air spectrograms.

This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul.

In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant."}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces."}

The study begins with an in-depth analysis of the pSA process, focusing on the issues resulting from unexpected oscillations among p-bits. These oscillations hinder the energy reduction of the Ising model and thus obstruct the successful execution of pSA in complex tasks. Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems. On the 16 benchmarks from 800 to 5,000 nodes, the proposed methods improve the normalized cut value from 0.8% to 98.4% on average in comparison with the conventional pSA."}

It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work."}

Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications."}

ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD."}

CTSN effectively improves the deficiencies of ternary spiking neuron, while the embedded learnable factors enable CTSN to adaptively adjust neuron dynamics, providing strong neural heterogeneity. Furthermore, based on the temporal evolution features of ternary spiking neurons' membrane potential distributions, we propose the Temporal Membrane Potential Regularization (TMPR) training method. TMPR introduces time-varying regularization strategy utilizing membrane potentials, furhter enhancing the training process by creating extra backpropagation paths.

As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies.

Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization."}

This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing."}

To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty."}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces."}

Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a hybrid quantum-HPC method in which information from a molecular Hamiltonian is encoded into a quantum circuit for evaluation on a quantum computer. A set of measurements on the quantum computer yields electronic configurations that are filtered on the classical computer, which also performs diagonalization on the selected subspace and identifies configurations to be carried over to the next step in an iterative process. Diagonalization is the most demanding task for the classical computer. Previous studies used the Fugaku supercomputer and a highly scalable diagonalization code designed for CPUs. In this work, we describe our efforts to enable efficient scalable and portable diagonalization on heterogeneous systems using GPUs as the main compute engines based on the previous work.\n  GPUs provide massive on-device thread-level parallelism that is well aligned with the algorithms used for diagonalization. We focus on the computation of ground-state energies and wavefunctions using the Davidson algorithm with a selected set of electron configurations. We describe the offload strategy, code transformations, and data-movement, with examples of measurements on the Frontier supercomputer and five other GPU accelerated systems. Our measurements show that GPUs provide an outstanding performance boost of order 100x on a per-node basis. This dramatically expedites the diagonalization step-essential for extracting ground and excited state energies-bringing the classical processing time down from hours to minutes."}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

To ensure fast and safe charging, complex communication is required between the vehicle and the charging station. In the globally used Combined Charging System (CCS), this communication is carried over the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) physical layer. However, HPGP is known to suffer from wireless leakage, which may expose this data link to nearby attackers.\n  In this paper, we examine active wireless attacks against CCS, and study the impact they can have. We present the first real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) implementation of HPGP, granting unprecedented access to the communications within the charging cables. We analyze the characteristics of 2,750 real-world charging sessions to understand the timing constraints for hijacking. Using novel techniques to increase the attacks' reliability, we design a robust wireless Man-in-the-Middle evaluation framework for CCS.\n  We demonstrate full control over TLS usage and CCS protocol version negotiation, including TLS stripping attacks. We investigate how real devices respond to safety-critical MitM attacks, which modify power delivery information, and found target vehicles to be highly permissive.

However, most existing systems are designed for English-speaking users interacting via keyboards, which limits accessibility in multilingual and voice-first settings, particularly in regions like India. Voice-based interfaces offer a more inclusive modality, but spoken queries involving code present unique challenges due to the presence of non-standard English usage, domain-specific vocabulary, and custom identifiers such as variable and function names, often combined with code-mixed expressions. In this work, we develop a multilingual speech-driven framework for code understanding that accepts spoken queries in a user native language, transcribes them using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applies code-aware ASR output refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs), and interfaces with code models to perform tasks such as code question answering and code retrieval through benchmarks such as CodeSearchNet, CoRNStack, and CodeQA. Focusing on four widely spoken Indic languages and English, we systematically characterize how transcription errors impact downstream task performance. We also identified key failure modes in ASR for code and demonstrated that LLM-guided refinement significantly improves performance across both transcription and code understanding stages. Our findings underscore the need for code-sensitive adaptations in speech interfaces and offer a practical solution for building robust, multilingual voice-driven programming tools."}

We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer."}

The flexible assembly flow shop scheduling problem formally defines dependencies for multi-stage kitting, yet dynamic variants make designing integrated scheduling rules under multi-level time coupling highly challenging. Existing automated heuristic design methods, particularly genetic programming constrained to fixed terminal symbol sets, struggle to capture and leverage dynamic uncertainties and hierarchical dependency information under transient decision states. This study develops an LLM-assisted Dynamic Rule Design framework (LLM4DRD) that automatically evolves integrated online scheduling rules adapted to scheduling features. Firstly, multi-stage processing and assembly supply decisions are transformed into feasible directed edge orderings based on heterogeneous graph. Then, an elite knowledge guided initialization embeds advanced design expertise into initial rules to enhance initial quality. Additionally, a dual-expert mechanism is introduced in which LLM-A evolutionary code to generate candidate rules and LLM-S conducts scheduling evaluation, while dynamic feature-fitting rule evolution combined with hybrid evaluation enables continuous improvement and extracts adaptive rules with strong generalization capability. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method. The average tardiness of LLM4DRD is 3.17-12.39% higher than state-of-the-art methods in 20 practical instances used for training and testing, respectively. In 24 scenarios with different resource configurations, order loads, and disturbance levels totaling 480 instances, it achieves 11.10% higher performance than the second best competitor, exhibiting excellent robustness."}

Using a simple \"uses\" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems."}

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy."}

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms."}

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery."}

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace. Extensive experiments on the AI4Privacy PII-Masking dataset using Pythia models demonstrate that our method effectively removes target PII while maintaining model utility."}

They can easily lead to infinite loops or executions, exhaust resources, or introduce logical errors that degrade performance and compromise security. The problem are often undetected by traditional static analyzers because such tools rely on syntactic patterns, which makes them struggle to detect semantic flaws. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for vulnerability detection because of their ability to understand code contextually. Moreover, local LLMs unlike commercial ones like ChatGPT or Gemini addresses issues such as privacy, latency, and dependency concerns by facilitating efficient offline analysis. Consequently, this study proposes a prompt-based framework that utilize local LLMs for the detection of loop vulnerabilities within Python 3.7+ code. The framework targets three categories of loop-related issues, such as control and logic errors, security risks inside loops, and resource management inefficiencies. A generalized and structured prompt-based framework was designed and tested with two locally deployed LLMs (LLaMA 3.2; 3B and Phi 3.5; 4B) by guiding their behavior via iterative prompting. The designed prompt-based framework included key safeguarding features such as language-specific awareness, code-aware grounding, version sensitivity, and hallucination prevention. The LLM results were validated against a manually established baseline truth, and the results indicate that Phi outperforms LLaMA in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings emphasize the importance of designing effective prompts for local LLMs to perform secure and accurate code vulnerability analysis."}

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing."}

This particle-based formulation yields clear individuation of cells, allows heterogeneous dynamics, and concentrates computation only on regions where activity is present. At the same time, particle systems pose challenges: neighborhoods are dynamic, and a naive implementation of local interactions scale quadratically with the number of particles. We address these challenges by replacing grid-based neighborhood perception with differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) operators backed by memory-efficient, CUDA-accelerated kernels, enabling scalable end-to-end training. Across tasks including morphogenesis, point-cloud classification, and particle-based texture synthesis, we show that NPA retain key NCA behaviors such as robustness and self-regeneration, while enabling new behaviors specific to particle systems. Together, these results position NPA as a compact neural model for learning self-organizing particle dynamics."}

Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications."}

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining analytical precision with machine learning algorithms to enhance the precision and reliability of robotic systems."}

We characterize the caching system inside OVS from a security perspective and identify three attack primitives. Based on the attack primitives, we present three remote attacks via OVS, breaking the isolation in virtualized environments. First, we identify remote covert channels using different caches. Second, we present a novel header recovery attack that leaks a remote user's packet header fields, breaking the confidentiality guarantees from the system. Third, we demonstrate a remote packet rate monitoring attack that recovers the packet rate of a remote victim. To defend against these attacks, we also discuss and evaluate mitigation solutions."}

These libraries are complex and contain bugs. Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.\n  To address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.\n  We develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.\n  We evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively. Using Centaur, we also detect 26 new bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 18 of which are confirmed."}

We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, recently introduced in the literature. The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios. We also show that dampened Mann iteration applies immediately to compute the expected payoff in various probabilistic models, including simple stochastic games, not covered by previous work."}

This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing."}

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information.

This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation.

We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level.

Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

In such settings, interoperability cannot rely on shared interpretation, negotiated semantics, or centralized authority. Instead, representations must function as neutral substrates that preserve stable reference across incompatible extensions. This paper investigates the structural constraints imposed on ontological design by this requirement. Building on a neutrality framework that treats interpretive non-commitment and stability under extension as explicit design constraints, we ask what minimal ontological structure is forced if accountability relationships are to remain referable and comparable under disagreement. Minimality here is not mere parsimony: a reduction is admissible only if it does not reintroduce stability-critical distinctions as hidden roles, flags, or contextual predicates. We establish a conditional lower-bound result: any ontology capable of supporting accountability under persistent disagreement must realize at least six distinct identity-and-persistence regimes. We further show that a construction with exactly six such regimes is sufficient to satisfy the stated requirements without embedding causal or normative commitments in the substrate. The result is not a proposal for a universal ontology, but a constraint on what is possible when neutrality and stable reference are treated as non-negotiable design goals."}

However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies.

To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks.

To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces."}

However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace. This work demonstrates a rapidly deployable, model-free control framework capable of precise magnetic manipulation in a large workspace,validated using a 2D GI phantom."}

While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection. Conversely, the same cognitive profile was associated with improved justification accuracy under UML-aided inspection, indicating that higher cognitive abilities may support deeper reasoning processes when dealing with multi-modal information, i.e., diagrams and text."}

To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking."}

Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection."}

On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec.

On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models."}

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots."}

First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety.

However, these approaches remain confined to the spatial domain with limited feature representation. Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification.

Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR).

Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation."}

Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights.

This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume."}

Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that \"to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion\", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation. An important part in implementing such insight is to be played by managers (and by employees, also), who should develop the skills and know-how needed to keep a well-balanced emotional climate that effectively favors the maximization of individual and group motivation at the workplace."}

TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control.

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks."}

Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring.

Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems."}

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click.

Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics."}

We propose a somaesthetic-inspired alternative that uses the human body, rather than written words, as the medium of expression. We coin this embodied journaling, as people's isolated body movements and spoken words become the canvas of reflection. We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether. Rather, subconscious body motion and paralinguistic acoustic qualities unveiled deeper, sometimes hidden feelings, prompting reflection that happens after emotional expression rather than during it. We discuss both the capabilities and pitfalls of embodied journaling, ultimately challenging the idea that reflection culminates in linguistic reasoning."}

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI."}

A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers' understanding of diverse user perspectives, ability to identify persona needs, and confidence in translating them into design decisions, with higher satisfaction and stronger intention for professional adoption. Qualitative findings reveal how conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning.

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy."}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge."}

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction."}

Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI."}

To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion."}

This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA."}

Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy.

We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic."}

We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims.

We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space.

This systematic review synthesizes (1) the behavior change strategies used in existing HRI studies employing social robots to promote health behavior change, and (2) the evaluation methods applied to assess behavior change outcomes. Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics. The review also identified key characteristics of current evaluation practices, including study designs, settings, durations, and outcome measures, on the basis of which we propose several directions for future HRI research."}

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems."}

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory."}

Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches.

We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network. Empirical evaluations validate that our strategies can effectively improve generalization."}

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents."}

At each stage, the student is trained with a specific distillation method, while a frozen reference model from the previous stage anchors learned knowledge to mitigate forgetting. In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the teacher true class probability (TCP) that dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample to balance knowledge retention and integration.\n  By design, SMSKD supports arbitrary method combinations and stage counts with negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that SMSKD consistently improves student accuracy across diverse teacher student architectures and method combinations, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that stage wise distillation and reference model supervision are primary contributors to performance gains, with TCP based adaptive weighting providing complementary benefits. Overall, SMSKD is a practical and resource efficient solution for integrating heterogeneous KD methods."}

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks."}

This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax."}

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop.

This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching.

Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services."}

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information."}

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\\to \\int_ΩK(\\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\\log\\frac{1}ε\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments.

In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets.

This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover).

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\\% to about 1\\%."}

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness."}

Through detailed simulations, we unravel the root cause of this energy stagnation, identifying the feedback mechanism inherent to the pSA operation as the primary contributor to these disruptive oscillations. To address this challenge, we propose two novel algorithms, time average pSA (TApSA) and stalled pSA (SpSA). These algorithms are designed based on partial deactivation of p-bits and are thoroughly tested using Python simulations on maximum cut benchmarks that are typical combinatorial optimization problems.

We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots.

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace.

However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies.

To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation.

Extensive experiments conducted in simulation and real-world environments across various discrete complex terrains, demonstrate PUMA's exceptional agility and robustness in challenging scenarios."}

In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant."}

We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, recently introduced in the literature. The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios. We also show that dampened Mann iteration applies immediately to compute the expected payoff in various probabilistic models, including simple stochastic games, not covered by previous work."}
