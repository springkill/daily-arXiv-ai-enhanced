In our experiments, none of the state-of-the-art tools, including Arvada, Treevada and Kedavra were able to infer grammars for complex languages such as C, C++, and Java within 48 hours. Arvada and Treevada perform grammar inference directly on full-length input examples, which proves inefficient for large files commonly found in such languages. While Kedavra introduces data decomposition to create shorter examples for grammar inference, its lexical analysis still relies on the original inputs. Additionally, its strict no-overgeneralization constraint limits the construction of complex grammars.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Crucio, which builds a decomposition forest to extract short examples for lexical and grammar inference via a distributional matrix. Experimental results show that Crucio is the only method capable of successfully inferring grammars for complex programming languages (where the number of nonterminals is up to 23x greater than in prior benchmarks) within reasonable time limits. On the prior simple benchmark, Crucio achieves an average recall improvement of 1.37x and 1.19x over Treevada and Kedavra, respectively, and improves F1 scores by 1.21x and 1.13x."}

This survey introduces flag algebra to computer scientists working in logic, programming languages, automated verification, and formal methods. We take a logical perspective on flag algebra and present it in terms of syntax, semantics, and proof strategies, in a style closer to formal logic. One popular proof strategy derives valid inequalities by first proving inequalities in a labelled variant of flag algebra and then transferring them to the original unlabelled setting using the so-called downward operator. We explain this strategy in detail and highlight that its transfer mechanism relies on the notion of what we call an adjoint pair, reminiscent of Galois connections and categorical adjunctions, which appear frequently in work on automated verification and programming languages. Along the way, we work through representative examples, including Mantel's theorem and Goodman's bound on Ramsey multiplicity, to illustrate how mathematical arguments can be carried out symbolically in the flag algebra framework."}

In FIRRTL programs, the bit widths of many components are not specified explicitly and must be inferred during compilation. In mainstream FIRRTL compilers, such as the official compiler firtool, width inference is conducted by a compilation pass referred to as InferWidths, which may fail even for simple FIRRTL programs. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the width inference problem for FIRRTL programs. We show that, if the constraints obtained from a FIRRTL program are satisfiable, there exists a unique least solution. Based on this result, we propose a complete procedure for solving the width inference problem. We implement it in the interactive theorem prover Rocq and prove its functional correctness. From the Rocq implementation, we extract an OCaml implementation, which is the first formally verified implementation of the InferWidths pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can solve more instances than the official InferWidths pass in firtool, normally with high efficiency."}

Among the numerous existing approaches for resource analysis, affine type systems have been one dominant approach. However, these affine type systems fall short of deriving precise resource behavior of higher-order programs, particularly in cases that involve partial applications.\n  This article presents λ_\\ms{amor}^\\ms{na}}, a non-affine AARA-style dependent type system for resource reasoning about higher-order functional programs. The key observation is that the main issue in previous approaches comes from (i) the close coupling of types and resources, and (ii) the conflict between affine and higher-order typing mechanisms. To derive precise resource behavior of higher-order functions, λ_\\ms{amor}^\\ms{na}} decouples resources from types and follows a non-affine typing mechanism.

The efficiency of symbolic computation is largely constrained by such deep computations in high dimension. This creates a fundamental barrier on labelled data acquisition if leveraging supervised deep learning to accelerate symbolic computation. Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics. In this work, we address this problem by designing a series of intimately connected tasks for which a large amount of annotated data can be easily obtained. We pre-train a Transformer model with these data and then fine-tune it on the datasets for CAD ordering. Experiments on publicly available CAD ordering datasets show that on average the orderings predicted by the new model are significantly better than those suggested by the best heuristic methods."}

This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research.

In this paper we show how the features of functional logic programming are useful to implement program transformations in a compact and comprehensible manner. For this purpose, we propose to write program transformations as partially defined and non-deterministic operations. Since the implementation of non-determinism usually causes some overhead compared to deterministically defined operations, we compare our approach to a deterministic transformation method. We evaluate these alternatives for the functional logic language Curry and its intermediate representation FlatCurry which is used in various analysis and verification tools and compilers."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

However, supply chain entities involved in the design and fabrication of COTS components are considered untrusted from the consumer's standpoint due to the potential insertion of hidden malicious logic or hardware Trojans (HTs). Existing solutions to detect Trojans are largely inapplicable for COTS components due to their black-box nature and lack of access to a golden model. A few studies that apply require expensive equipment, lack scalability, and apply to a limited class of Trojans. In this work, we present a novel golden-free trust verification framework, COVERT for COTS microprocessors, which can efficiently test the presence of hardware Trojan implants by identifying microarchitectural rare events and transferring activation knowledge from existing processor designs to trigger highly susceptible internal nodes. COVERT leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate test programs that trigger rare microarchitectural events, which may be exploited to develop Trojan trigger conditions. By deriving these events from publicly available Register Transfer Level implementations, COVERT can verify a wide variety of COTS microprocessors that inherit the same Instruction Set Architecture. We have evaluated the proposed framework on open-source RISC-V COTS microprocessors and demonstrated its effectiveness in activating combinational and sequential Trojan triggers with high coverage, highlighting the efficiency of the trust verification. By pruning rare microarchitectural events from mor1kx Cappuccino OpenRISC processor design, COVERT has been able to achieve more than 80% trigger coverage for the rarest 5% of events in or1k Marocchino and PicoRV32 as COTS processors."}

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

As relQuery services become more widely adopted in applications such as AI-powered spreadsheets, fast response times under concurrent query loads are increasingly important. Unfortunately, current LLM engines face severe latency bottlenecks from Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking across three comparable inference phases: waiting, core running, and tail running. Existing static priority scheduling methods only address HoL blocking during the waiting phase, leaving two critical problems unsolved. First, the absence of a priority update mechanism causes inaccurate prioritization and continued HoL blocking during core execution. Second, suboptimal prefill-decode batching exacerbates HoL blocking in tail execution and worsens latency trade-offs between running and waiting relQueries. To address these problems, we propose RelServe, an optimized LLM engine for low-latency relQuery serving. RelServe features two core innovations: a Dynamic Priority Updater that continuously adjusts priorities while minimizing overhead via statistical approximations, and an Adaptive Batch Arranger that quantitatively evaluates candidate prefill and decode batches to minimize projected average latency. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets using LLMs ranging from 13B to 70B parameters show that RelServe reduces average serving latency by up to 3.1x compared to vLLM."}

In the proposed algorithm, historical results of fireflies' motions are used in hypothesis testing to limit the motions of fireflies that are suggested by current information exchanges between fireflies only to those that are potentially useful. Hypothesis testing is applied to the mechanism of an ordinary firefly algorithm (FA) without changing its structure. As a result, the implementation of the proposed algorithm is simple and straightforward. Limiting the motions of fireflies to those that are potential useful results in reduction of firefly evaluations, and, subsequently, reduction of computational efforts. To test the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, it is used to solve several truss topology optimization problems, including some benchmark problems. It is found that the added statistical strategy in the SFA significantly enhances the performance of the original FA in terms of computational efforts while still maintains the quality of the obtained results."}

Experiments across large-scale pre-training (English C4, Vietnamese VietVault) and fine-tuning (GLUE) demonstrate that AdaFRUGAL achieves a compelling trade-off.

First, we present a reduction strategy that soundly replaces parallel composition with sequential composition. Second, we generalize Lipton's reduction to support atomic sections containing (potentially recursive) procedure calls. Crucially, these two foundational strategies can be composed arbitrarily, greatly expanding the scope and flexibility of reduction-based reasoning. We implemented this technique in Civl and demonstrated its effectiveness on a number of challenging case studies, including a snapshot object, a fault-tolerant and linearizable register, the FLASH cache coherence protocol, and a non-trivial variant of Two-Phase Commit."}

First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods."}

We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code."}

When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications."}

However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency.

AlSalem AlKhashti"], "title": "Uniqueness ratio as a predictor of a privacy leakage", "comment": null, "summary": "Identity leakage can emerge when independent databases are joined, even when each dataset is anonymized individually. While previous work focuses on post-join detection or complex privacy models, little attention has been given to simple, interpretable pre-join indicators that can warn data engineers and database administrators before integration occurs. This study investigates the uniqueness ratio of candidate join attributes as an early predictor of re-identification risk. Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups. Our findings demonstrate that uniqueness ratio offers an explainable and practical signal for assessing join induced privacy risk, providing a foundation for developing more comprehensive pre-join risk estimation models."}

To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms."}

When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications."}

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems."}

Motivated by the observation that LLM embeddings exhibit distinct states, suggesting discrete semantic representations, we explore the application of these mathematical tools to analyze semantic relationships. We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics. While the interpretation warrants careful consideration, our results suggest that this approach offers a promising avenue for gaining deeper insights into LLMs and potentially informing new methods for mitigating hallucinations."}

It verifies a program by symbolically executing each function in isolation, exploiting user-annotated preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants written in a form of separation logic, and using a separation logic-based symbolic representation of memory. However, the tool itself, written in roughly 30K lines of OCaml code, has not been formally verified. Therefore, bugs in the tool could cause it to falsely report the correctness of the input program. We here report on an early result extending VeriFast to emit, upon successful verification of a Rust program, a Rocq proof script that proves correctness of the program with respect to a Rocq-encoded axiomatic semantics of Rust. This significantly enhances VeriFast's applicability in safety-critical domains. We apply hinted mirroring: we record key information from VeriFast's symbolic execution run, and use it to direct a replay of the run in Rocq."}

Refining the well-known equivalence of the DLS theorem to the axiom of dependent choice (DC) over classical base theories, our constructive approach allows for several finer logical decompositions: Just assuming countable choice (CC), the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of DC with a newly identified fragment of the excluded middle (LEM) that we call the blurred drinker paradox (BDP). Further without CC, the DLS theorem is equivalent to the conjunction of BDP with similarly blurred weakenings of DC and CC. Independently of their connection with the DLS theorem, we also study BDP and the blurred choice axioms on their own, for instance by showing that BDP is LEM without a contribution of Markov's principle and that blurred DC is DC without a contribution of CC.

Bills of Materials (BOMs) have emerged as a structured way to document product components, their interrelationships, and key metadata, improving visibility and security across digital supply chains. This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains. Finally, we identify four key gaps that limit the usability and reliability of today's BOM frameworks, motivating future research directions."}

This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time."}

This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant \"HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity\" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates. We show that this architectural shift enables a truly serverless, cost-per-query deployment model, challenging the necessity of large in-memory ANN indexes for high-quality semantic search."}

Particular instances for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented. Then, we use our model to prove the Turing-completeness of SLS algorithms in general. The proof uses our framework to construct a GA able to simulate any Turing machine. This Turing-completeness implies that determining any non-trivial property concerning the relationship between the inputs and the computed outputs is undecidable for GA and, by extension, for the general set of SLS methods (although not necessarily for each particular method). Similar proofs are more informally presented for PSO and ACO."}

Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment."}

This problem is challenging, especially for expressive languages that feature loops or unbounded recursion. While most of the existing literature focuses on statistical approximation, in this paper we address the problem of mathematically exact inference.\n  To achieve this for programs with loops, we rely on a relatively underexplored type of probabilistic loop invariant, which is linked to a loop's so-called occupation measure. The occupation measure associates program states with their expected number of visits, given the initial distribution. Based on this, we derive the notion of an occupation invariant. Such invariants are essentially dual to probabilistic martingales, the predominant technique for formal probabilistic loop analysis in the literature. A key feature of occupation invariants is that they can take the initial distribution into account and often yield a proof of positive almost sure termination as a by-product.\n  Finally, we present an automatic, template-based invariant synthesis approach for occupation invariants by encoding them as generating functions. The approach is implemented and evaluated on a set of benchmarks."}

Towards this end, we first review the physical principles of metasurfaces and their various applications, followed by an exploration of manufacturing approaches for creating these structures.

Previous work has demonstrated that real-time biofeedback targeting anterior ground reaction forces (AGRFs) can increase propulsion in individuals post-stroke, however this work was confined to lab-based treadmills, limiting practical utility. Here we investigate the short-term effects of real-time AGRF gait biofeedback during overground walking using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a haptic feedback device. Eight individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis completed four 3-minute training bouts. During training, faded haptic biofeedback was provided to increase paretic AGRF during terminal stance. Gait biomechanics were assessed before, during, and after training, and during a retention test conducted without biofeedback after a rest period. The primary dependent variable was peak paretic AGRF, while secondary variables included paretic peak trailing limb angle (TLA), step length and walking speed. Compared to baseline, peak AGRF increased post-feedback and at the retention tests. Similar trends were observed in TLA, and step length, although these increases were not statistically significant while speed showed a significant change from baseline. Examining individual participants 63% participants (responders) increased AGRF at retention, while 37% experienced decreases (non-responders). Non-responders had lower physical capability, evidenced by two-minute walk distance at screening and AFO use during training, suggesting this intervention may suit patients with more residual ankle mobility and strength. Nonetheless our results suggest AGRF biofeedback can be implemented in practical settings with wearable systems and is a promising gait training strategy to target propulsive deficits in individuals post stroke."}

We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks."}

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework."}

To address these challenges, we designed a multimodal system combining AR visuals with a custom wrist-worn haptic device delivering directional and state-based cues. A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time.

Our measurements indicate that these timing variations stem from the micro-op cache placement and the jump's offset in the L1 instruction cache of modern processors. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent across multiple microarchitectures, including Skylake, Coffee Lake, and Kaby Lake, as well as various real-world implementations. We confirm the prevalence of this variability through extensive experiments on a large-scale set of popular binaries, including libraries from Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 10 Pro, and several open-source cryptographic libraries. We also show that one can easily avoid this timing variability by ensuring that macro-fusible instructions are 32-byte aligned - an approach initially suggested in 2019 by Intel in an overlooked short report. We quantify the performance impact of this approach across the cryptographic libraries, showing a speedup of 2.15% on average (and up to 10.54%) when avoiding the timing variability. As a by-product, we show that this variability can be exploited as a covert channel, achieving a maximum throughput of 16.14 Mbps."}

Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%. This methodology supports automated analysis of large embedded software systems and enables downstream applications such as training data generation for systems-aware machine learning models, standards compliance verification, and large-scale specification coverage analysis."}

While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\\times$ to $105\\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\\times$ to $266\\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency.

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions.

Method: We conducted a Rapid Review with snowballing to select the appropriate peer-reviewed studies. We leveraged the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Springer as our primary source databases. Results: Technical lag accumulates passively, often unnoticed due to inadequate detection metrics and tools. It negatively impacts software quality through outdated dependencies, obsolete APIs, unsupported platforms, and aging infrastructure. Strategies to manage technical lag primarily involve automated dependency updates, continuous integration processes, and regular auditing. Conclusions: Enhancing and extending the current standardized metrics, detection methods, and empirical studies to use technical lag as an indication of accumulated latent debt can greatly improve the process of maintaining large codebases that are heavily dependent on external packages.

As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality.\n  In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan. Q2O is capable of handling actual queries in real time."}

They excel in performing simple and repetitive unimanual tasks but still face challenges with bimanual manipulation. This difficulty arises from the complexities of coordinating dual arms and handling multi-stage processes. Recent integration of generative models into imitation learning (IL) has made progress in tackling specific challenges. However, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while also emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In multi-stage tasks, failures or delays at any stage can cascade over time, impacting the success and efficiency of subsequent sub-stages and ultimately hindering overall task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel keypose-conditioned coordination-aware consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. Our framework instantiates hierarchical imitation learning with a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes serve as sub-goals for trajectory generation, indicating targets for individual sub-stages. The trajectory generator is formulated as a consistency model, generating action sequences based on historical observations and predicted keyposes in a single inference step. In particular, we devise an innovative approach for identifying bimanual keyposes, considering both robot-centric action features and task-centric operation styles. Simulation and real-world experiments illustrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rates and operational efficiency.

Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.\n  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.\n  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs."}

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms.

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning.

Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework.

To that end, we introduce a novel reduction from verification of arbitrary temporal properties to verification of termination. Our reduction augments the system with prophecy timer variables that predict the number of steps along a trace until the next time certain temporal formulas, including the negated property, hold. In contrast to standard tableaux-based reductions, which reduce the problem to fair termination, our reduction does not introduce fairness assumptions. To verify termination of the augmented system, we follow the traditional approach of assigning each state a rank from a well-founded set and showing that the rank decreases in every transition. We leverage the recently proposed formalism of implicit rankings to express and automatically verify the decrease of rank using SMT solvers, even when the rank is not expressible in first-order logic. We extend implicit rankings from finite to infinite domains, enabling verification of more general systems and making them applicable to the augmented systems generated by our reduction, which allows us to exploit the decrease of timers in termination proofs. We evaluate our technique on a range of temporal verification tasks from previous works, giving simple, intuitive proofs for them within our framework."}

This survey introduces flag algebra to computer scientists working in logic, programming languages, automated verification, and formal methods. We take a logical perspective on flag algebra and present it in terms of syntax, semantics, and proof strategies, in a style closer to formal logic. One popular proof strategy derives valid inequalities by first proving inequalities in a labelled variant of flag algebra and then transferring them to the original unlabelled setting using the so-called downward operator. We explain this strategy in detail and highlight that its transfer mechanism relies on the notion of what we call an adjoint pair, reminiscent of Galois connections and categorical adjunctions, which appear frequently in work on automated verification and programming languages. Along the way, we work through representative examples, including Mantel's theorem and Goodman's bound on Ramsey multiplicity, to illustrate how mathematical arguments can be carried out symbolically in the flag algebra framework."}

In particular, a novel security degree metric is introduced to quantify the UAV trustworthiness. Based on this architecture, we propose a beam search-proximal policy optimization (BSPPO) algorithm, where beam search (BS) pre-screens the high-security candidate paths, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) performs hop-by-hop routing decisions to support dynamic rerouting upon attack detections. Finally, extensive simulations under varying attack densities, packet sizes, and rerouting events demonstrate that BSPPO outperforms PPO, BS-Q learning, and BS-actor critic in terms of delay, energy consumption, and transmission success rate, showing the outstanding robustness and adaptability."}

Focus on 6-DOF spacecraft rendezvous and docking control using imitation learning-based control method", "summary": "Existing spacecraft rendezvous and docking control methods largely rely on predefined dynamic models and often exhibit limited robustness in realistic on-orbit environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

As an open ISA, RISC-V lowers the barriers to processor design and encourages widespread adoption, but also exposes processors to security risks such as functional bugs. Processor fuzzing is a powerful technique for automatically detecting these bugs. However, existing fuzzing methods suffer from two main limitations. First, their emphasis on redundant test case generation causes them to overlook cross-processor corner cases. Second, they rely too heavily on coverage guidance. Current coverage metrics are biased and inefficient, and become ineffective once coverage growth plateaus. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimFuzz, a fuzzing framework that constructs a high-quality seed corpus from historical bug-triggering inputs and employs similarity-guided, block-level mutation to efficiently explore the processor input space. By introducing instruction similarity, SimFuzz expands the input space around seeds while preserving control-flow structure, enabling deeper exploration without relying on coverage feedback. We evaluate SimFuzz on three widely used open-source RISC-V processors: Rocket, BOOM, and XiangShan, and discover 17 bugs in total, including 14 previously unknown issues, 7 of which have been assigned CVE identifiers. These bugs affect the decode and memory units, cause instruction and data errors, and can lead to kernel instability or system crashes. Experimental results show that SimFuzz achieves up to 73.22% multiplexer coverage on the high-quality seed corpus. Our findings highlight critical security bugs in mainstream RISC-V processors and offer actionable insights for improving functional verification."}

In this quasi-longitudinal study, we analyze five years of student source code submissions in a graduate-level cloud computing course, focusing on an assignment that remained unchanged and examining students' behavior during the period spanning five semesters before the release of ChatGPT and five semesters after.\n  Student coding behavior has changed significantly since Fall 2022. The length of their final submissions increased. Between consecutive submissions, average edit distances increased while average score improvement decreased, suggesting that both student productivity and learning have decreased after ChatGPT's release. Additionally, there are statistically significant correlations between these behavioral changes and their overall performance. Although we cannot definitively attribute them to LLM misuse, they are consistent with our hypothesis that some students are over-reliant on LLMs, which is negatively affecting their learning outcomes. Our findings raise an alarm around the first generation of graduates in the age of LLMs, calling upon both educators and employers to reflect on their evaluation methods for genuine expertise and productivity."}

Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints. This CBF formulation is fully compatible with the learned AttNP controller and generalizes across a wide range of racing scenarios, providing a lightweight and certifiable safety layer. Our results demonstrate competitive closed-loop performance while ensuring real-time constraint satisfaction."}

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance."}

Thus, patients require lifelong insulin therapy, which has a side effect of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a critical state of decreased blood glucose levels (BGL) below 70 mg/dL and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs). Particularly, we explore: 1) How much in advance can glucose values or a hypoglycemic event be accurately predicted? 2) Which models have the best performance? 3) Which factors impact the performance? and 4) Does personalization increase performance? The results show that 1) a PH of up to 1 hour provides the best results. 2) Conventional ML methods yield the best results for classification and DL for regression. A single model cannot adequately classify across multiple PHs. 3) The model performance is influenced by multivariate datasets and the input sequence length (ISL). 4) Personal data enhances performance but due to limited data quality population-based models are preferred."}

We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning.

In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the width inference problem for FIRRTL programs. We show that, if the constraints obtained from a FIRRTL program are satisfiable, there exists a unique least solution. Based on this result, we propose a complete procedure for solving the width inference problem. We implement it in the interactive theorem prover Rocq and prove its functional correctness. From the Rocq implementation, we extract an OCaml implementation, which is the first formally verified implementation of the InferWidths pass.

While the ubiquity and low cost of commodity Wi-Fi make it an ideal platform for wide-scale sensing, it is the continuous evolution of Wi-Fi standards-towards higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays-that fundamentally unlocks the physical resources required for high-performance ISAC. To structure this rapidly expanding field, numerous surveys have appeared. However, prevailing literature predominantly adopts a top-down perspective, emphasizing upper-layer applications or deep learning models while treating the physical layer as an opaque abstraction. Consequently, these works often fail to touch the bottom layer of signal formation and lack technical guidance on overcoming the physical barriers that constrain sensing performance. To bridge this gap, this tutorial takes a bottom-up approach, systematically analyzing the sensing gains brought by Wi-Fi advancements through the lens of physical-layer diversity. We organize the framework around four orthogonal dimensions: i) Temporal Diversity addresses synchronization gaps to enable absolute ranging; ii) Frequency Diversity expands the effective bandwidth to sharpen range resolution; iii) Link Diversity leverages distributed topologies and digital feedback to achieve ubiquitous observability; and iv) Spatial Diversity utilizes multi-antenna arrays to combine passive angular discrimination with active directional control. Collectively, these orthogonal dimensions resolve fundamental ambiguities in time, range, and space, bridging physical capabilities with challenging sensing diversities. By synthesizing these dimensions, this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide for \"ISAC-izing\" commodity Wi-Fi, paving the way for future standardization and robust deployment."}

LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.\n  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.\n  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds.

Based on a formal model of LLM agent systems, we identify novel privilege escalation scenarios, particularly in multi-agent systems, including a variant akin to the classic confused deputy problem. To defend against both known and newly demonstrated privilege escalation, we propose SEAgent, a mandatory access control (MAC) framework built upon attribute-based access control (ABAC). SEAgent monitors agent-tool interactions via an information flow graph and enforces customizable security policies based on entity attributes. Our evaluations show that SEAgent effectively blocks various privilege escalation while maintaining a low false positive rate and negligible system overhead.

Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement.

Unlike prior TLA+ based approaches which use a technique called trace validation, OmniLink treats system events as black boxes with a timebox in which they occurred and a meaning in TLA+, solving for a logical total order of actions. Unlike prior approaches based on linearizability checking, which already solves for total orders of actions with timeboxes, OmniLink uses a flexible specification language, and offers a different linearizability checking method based on off-the-shelf model checking. OmniLink offers different features compared existing linearizability checking tools, and we show that it outperforms the state of the art on large scale validation tasks.\n  Our evaluation validates WiredTiger, a state-of-the-art industrial database storage layer, as well as Balanced Augmented Tree (BAT), a state-of-the art lock-free data structure from the research community, and ConcurrentQueue, a popular lock-free queue featuring aggressive performance optimizations.

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem."}

Moore", "Easop Lee", "Boyuan Chen"], "title": "Learning Legged MPC with Smooth Neural Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning and model predictive control (MPC) can play complementary roles in legged robotics. However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

To address this limitation, we propose a $\\textbf{Feedback-Driven Iterative Framework}$ for comprehensive test case construction. Specifically, our method leverages the LLM to generate initial test cases, executes them against known correct and incorrect solutions, and utilizes the failed results as feedback to guide the LLM in refining the test cases toward high fidelity and discriminability.

We present a SAT-based function-recovery attack that reconstructs hidden gate operations from a circuit's public topology. To enable recovery on larger and more complex circuits, we develop an incremental SAT-solving framework combined with a set of composable, topology-preserving simplification theorems. These techniques jointly reduce the SAT instance size and progressively constrain the search space across repeated solving iterations.\n  We evaluate our attack on ISCAS benchmarks, representative secure computation circuits, and fault-tolerant sensor fusion circuits under a fixed 24-hour recovery budget.

During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\\varrho\\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\\varrho \\in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network. We present a $\\max(\\frac{1}{\\varrho\\cdotλ_{\\text{min}}},2)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, with $λ_{\\text{min}}$ denoting the minimum number of connections between any two connected routers.

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, \"FLAML\", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated.

Consequently, there is a need for a more adaptive and context-aware interviewing system. To address this, an AI-powered interviewer that dynamically generates questions that are contextually appropriate and expertise aligned is presented in this study. The interviewer is built on a locally hosted large language model (LLM) that generates coherent dialogue while preserving data privacy. The interviewer profiles the participants' expertise in real time to generate knowledge-appropriate questions, well-articulated responses, and smooth transition messages similar to human-like interviews. To implement these functionalities, a modular prompt engineering pipeline was designed to ensure that the interview conversation remains scalable, adaptive, and semantically rich. To evaluate the AI-powered interviewer, it was tested with various participants, and it achieved high satisfaction (mean 4.45) and engagement (mean 4.33).

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity).

In this paper, we present an AR-assisted assembly workflow that leverages object recognition and hand tracking to (1) identify custom components, (2) display step-by-step instructions, (3) detect assembly deviations, and (4) dynamically update the instructions based on users' hands-on interactions with physical parts. Using object recognition, the system detects and localizes components in real time to create a digital twin of the workspace. For each assembly step, it overlays bounding boxes in AR to indicate both the current position and the target placement of relevant components, while hand-tracking data verifies whether the user interacts with the correct part. Rather than enforcing a fixed sequence, the system highlights potential assembly errors and interprets user deviations as opportunities for iteration and creative exploration. A case study with LEGO blocks and custom 3D-printed components demonstrates how the system links digital instructions to physical assembly, eliminating the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of parts."}

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

However, existing frameworks typically require explicit data export and extensive feature engineering, creating a high barrier for database practitioners. We present TLSQL (Table Learning Structured Query Language), a system that enables table learning directly over relational databases via SQL-like declarative specifications. TLSQL is implemented as a lightweight Python library that translates these specifications into standard SQL queries and structured learning task descriptions. The generated SQL queries are executed natively by the database engine, while the task descriptions are consumed by downstream table learning frameworks. This design allows users to focus on modeling and analysis rather than low-level data preparation and pipeline orchestration. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TLSQL effectively lowers the barrier to integrating machine learning into databasecentric workflows.

While the current trend is to use learning-based approaches to replace traditional geometry-based methods, existing end-to-end learning-based policies often struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and lack a comprehensive understanding of physical world dynamics. Integrating world models-which predict future observations conditioned on given actions-with iterative optimization planning offers a promising solution due to their capacity for imagination and flexibility. However, current navigation world models, typically built on pure transformer architectures, often rely on multi-step diffusion processes and autoregressive frame-by-frame generation. These mechanisms result in prohibitive computational latency, rendering real-time deployment impossible. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight navigation world model that adopts a one-step generation paradigm and a 3D U-Net backbone equipped with efficient spatial-temporal attention. This design drastically reduces inference latency, enabling high-frequency control while achieving superior predictive performance. We also integrate this model into an optimization-based planning framework utilizing anchor-based initialization to handle multi-modal goal navigation tasks. Extensive closed-loop experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate our system's superior efficiency and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling.

Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off."}

In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results. Our findings are demonstrated through the application of this approach to the generation of fuzz targets for C/C++ libraries."}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics."}

We further introduce a stochastic risk modeling approach that treats re-identification risk as a random variable evolving over time, enabling distributional evaluation through Monte Carlo simulation. Adapting quantitative risk measures from financial mathematics, we define Privacy Loss at Risk (P-VaR) to characterize worst-case privacy outcomes under realistic cohort dynamics and adversary assumptions.\n  We validate our framework through system-level analysis and simulation experiments, demonstrating how privacy-utility tradeoffs can be operationalized for digital health platforms.

However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \\texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint."}

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, \"FLAML\", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated. The study found that the best model was the \"FLAML\" library's \"XGBoost limited depth\" model with an accuracy of 71%."}

Balancing these competing requirements, privacy preservation and verifiable accountability, remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present CoSMeTIC, a zero-knowledge computational framework that proposes computational Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs) as a means to generate verifiable inclusion and exclusion proofs for individual participants' data in clinical studies. We formally analyze the zero-knowledge properties of CoSMeTIC and evaluate its computational efficiency through extensive experiments. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and likelihood-ratio hypothesis tests, along with logistic-regression-based genomic analyses on real-world Huntington's disease datasets, we demonstrate that CoSMeTIC achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining statistical fidelity.

Previous work has demonstrated that real-time biofeedback targeting anterior ground reaction forces (AGRFs) can increase propulsion in individuals post-stroke, however this work was confined to lab-based treadmills, limiting practical utility. Here we investigate the short-term effects of real-time AGRF gait biofeedback during overground walking using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a haptic feedback device. Eight individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis completed four 3-minute training bouts. During training, faded haptic biofeedback was provided to increase paretic AGRF during terminal stance. Gait biomechanics were assessed before, during, and after training, and during a retention test conducted without biofeedback after a rest period. The primary dependent variable was peak paretic AGRF, while secondary variables included paretic peak trailing limb angle (TLA), step length and walking speed. Compared to baseline, peak AGRF increased post-feedback and at the retention tests. Similar trends were observed in TLA, and step length, although these increases were not statistically significant while speed showed a significant change from baseline. Examining individual participants 63% participants (responders) increased AGRF at retention, while 37% experienced decreases (non-responders). Non-responders had lower physical capability, evidenced by two-minute walk distance at screening and AFO use during training, suggesting this intervention may suit patients with more residual ankle mobility and strength. Nonetheless our results suggest AGRF biofeedback can be implemented in practical settings with wearable systems and is a promising gait training strategy to target propulsive deficits in individuals post stroke."}

Traditional rule-based tools often overlook the semantic patterns in source code that are crucial for identifying adversarial components.

This paper presents LAMPS, a multi-agent system that employs collaborative LLMs to detect malicious PyPI packages. The system consists of four role-specific agents for package retrieval, file extraction, classification, and verdict aggregation, coordinated through the CrewAI framework. A prototype combines a fine-tuned CodeBERT model for classification with LLaMA-3 agents for contextual reasoning. LAMPS has been evaluated on two complementary datasets: D1, a balanced collection of 6,000 setup.py files, and D2, a realistic multi-file dataset with 1,296 files and natural class imbalance. On D1, LAMPS achieves 97.7% accuracy, surpassing MPHunter--one of the state-of-the-art approaches. On D2, it reaches 99.5% accuracy and 99.5% balanced accuracy, outperforming RAG-based approaches and fine-tuned single-agent baselines.

VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

However, in edge network environments, high user mobility and implicit service intents pose significant challenges to the passive and reactive management of traditional AAI. To address the limitations of existing approaches in handling dynamic demands and predicting users' implicit intents, in this paper we propose an edge service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework empowered by a Generative Intent Prediction Agent (GIPA). Our GIPA aims to shift the paradigm from passive execution to proactive prediction and orchestration. First, we construct a multidimensional intent space that includes functional preferences, QoS sensitivity, and resource requirements, enabling the mapping from unstructured natural language to quantifiable physical resource demands. Second, to cope with the complexity and randomness of intent sequences, we design an intent prediction model based on a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM), which reconstructs users' implicit intents from multidimensional context through a reverse denoising process. Finally, the predicted implicit intents are embedded as global prompts into the SFC orchestration model to guide the network in proactively and ahead-of-time optimizing SFC deployment strategies. Experiment results show that GIPA outperforms existing baseline methods in highly concurrent and highly dynamic scenarios."}

Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.\n  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.\n  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs."}

This paper introduces a robust, cost-effective sign language recognition system tailored for the Nepali Sign Language (NSL) community. Departing from traditional resistive sensing, we implement a non-contact Hall-effect architecture that correlates magnetic field intensity with finger flexion, eliminating mechanical wear and signal drift. The system integrates 14 sensor nodes across the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints, augmented by an MPU6050 IMU for wrist orientation. An embedded Multi-Layer Perceptron, executed locally on an Arduino Mega, performs gesture classification, negating the need for cloud dependencies. With a Bill of Materials between \\$80 and \\$100, this solution is approximately 30 times more affordable than market alternatives. Validation trials across five subjects yielded 96\\% accuracy on a fundamental NSL vocabulary.

Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe.

The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body movements, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked limbs and face signals. Since the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch synchronized with the visual perception of the robot's hands on their hands: the operator's finger and hand motion is mapped to the robot avatar using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb control, our VR2VR system supports social retargeting of multiple nonverbal cues, which can be experimentally varied and investigated while keeping the physical interaction constant.

Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Intent-Driven General Agentic AI (IGAA) framework. Leveraging a meta-learning paradigm, IGAA enables AAI to continuously learn from prior service scheduling experiences to achieve generalized scheduling capabilities. Particularly, IGAA incorporates three core mechanisms. First, we design a Network-Service-Intent matrix mapping method to allow agents to simulate novel scenarios and generate training datasets. Second, we present an easy-to-hard generalization learning scheme with two customized algorithms, namely Resource Causal Effect-aware Transfer Learning (RCETL) and Action Potential Optimality-aware Transfer Learning (APOTL). These algorithms help IGAA adapt to new scenarios. Furthermore, to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual IGAA learning, we propose a Generative Intent Replay (GIR) mechanism that synthesizes historical service data to consolidate prior capabilities. Finally, to mitigate the effect of LLM hallucinations on scenario simulation, we incorporate a scenario evaluation and correction model to guide agents in generating rational scenarios and datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate IGAA's strong generalization and scalability. Specifically, IGAA enables rapid adaptation by transferring learned policies to analogous new ones, such as applying latency-sensitive patterns from real-time computing to optimize novel Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services.

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs."}

We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability. These findings highlight key challenges and opportunities for deploying LLMs in practical software engineering workflows."}

Di-BM associates each expert with a distinct observation distribution, enabling experts to specialize in sub-regions of the observation space. Specifically, we employ energy-based models to represent expert-specific observation distributions and jointly train them alongside the corresponding action models. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into standard imitation learning methods. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Di-BM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

It performs structured feature refinement through frequency-domain filtering and temporal detection. Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. The design principles of the module are explained from the perspectives of the information bottleneck and regularization.

However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.\n  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal).

Using a mixed-methods approach which integrates quantitative Likert-scale questions with qualitative commentary, we analyze the student perspective on feedback quality, evaluated based on multiple criteria, including readability, detail, specificity, actionability, helpfulness, and overall quality. The analysis reveals that in the larger upper-year operating systems course ($N=80$), SLMs and LLMs are perceived to deliver clear, actionable, and well-structured feedback, while humans provide more contextually nuanced guidance. As for the high-enrollment CS2 course ($N=176$) showed the same preference for the AI tools' clarity and breadth, but students noted that AI feedback sometimes lacked the concise, straight-to-the-point, guidance offered by humans. Conversely, in the smaller upper-year technical writing course on AI topics ($N=7$), all students preferred feedback from the course instructor, who was able to provide clear, specific, and personalized feedback, compared to the more general and less targeted AI-based feedback.

To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations.

Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

This paper proposes an interoperable rApp/xApp-driven dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) framework for O-RAN, based on a graph-theoretic formulation of physical resource block (PRB) assignment. The proposed architecture leverages a non-real-time radio intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) rApp to predict aggregated traffic evolution and generate high-level spectrum policies at the minutes timescale, while a near-real-time RIC (Near-RT RIC) xApp constructs a user-centric conflict graph and performs fairness-aware PRB allocation at sub-second timescales. To mitigate persistent user starvation, a conflict-aware modified proportional fair (MPF) scheduling mechanism is applied, enabling controlled interference-free PRB time-sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the PRB assignment success rate (above 90%) and service-share fairness (above 85%) across different channel configurations and user demands, while maintaining architectural separation and rApp/xApp interoperability in accordance with O-RAN principles."}

Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats."}

The resulting linear-Gaussian measurement model is learned in closed form from groundtruth training data, without iterative optimization or reliance on an explicit parametric sensor model.

IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol.

However, the performance of Starlink networks in mobility settings, particularly with frequent changes in the UT's orientation, and the impact of environmental factors, such as transient obstructions, has not been thoroughly studied, leaving gaps in understanding the causes of performance degradation. Recently, researchers have started identifying the communicating satellites to evaluate satellite selection strategies and the impact on network performance. However, existing Starlink satellite identification methods only work in stationary, obstruction-free scenarios, as they do not account for UT mobility, obstructions or detect dynamic beam switching events. In this paper, we reveal that the UT can perform multiple dynamic beam switching attempts to connect to different satellites when the UT-satellite link is degraded. This degradation can occur either due to the loss of line-of-sight (LoS) from changes in the FOV or obstructions, or due to poor signal quality, extending UT-satellite handovers beyond the well-known 15-second regular handover interval. We propose a mobility-aware Starlink satellite identification method that detects dynamic beam switching events, and plausibly explain network performance using UT's diagnostic data and connected satellite information. Our findings demystifies the mobile Starlink network performance degradations, which is crucial to enhance the end-to-end performance of transport layer protocols and in diverse application scenarios."}

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms.

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop.

Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load.

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

Leveraging this predictive capability, we introduce two analytically derived performance upper bounds-one based on Shannon capacity and the other on latency behavior under CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)-that can be evaluated efficiently without time-consuming network simulations. By applying importance sampling to DT-generated scenarios, potentially risky network conditions can be identified within large stochastic scenario spaces. These same performance bounds are then used to proactively guide a gradient-based search for improved network configurations, with the objective of avoiding imminent performance degradation rather than pursuing globally optimal but fragile solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully predict time-dependent network congestion and mitigate it in advance, highlighting its potential for predictive and preventive Wi-Fi network management."}

This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations.

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively."}

However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy."}

We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents."}

Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software."}

This paper studies a variant, HPP with Probabilistic Terminals (HPP-PT), where each vertex has a probability representing the likelihood that the robot's path terminates there, and the objective is to minimize the expected path cost. HPP-PT arises in target object search, where a mobile robot must visit all candidate locations to find an object, and prior knowledge of the object's location is expressed as vertex probabilities. While routing problems have been studied for decades, few of them consider uncertainty as required in this work. The challenge lies not only in optimally ordering the vertices, as in standard HPP, but also in handling history dependency: the expected path cost depends on the order in which vertices were previously visited. This makes many existing methods inefficient or inapplicable. To address the challenge, we propose a search-based approach RPT* with solution optimality guarantees, which leverages dynamic programming in a new state space to bypass the history dependency and novel heuristics to speed up the computation. Building on RPT*, we design a Hierarchical Autonomous Target Search (HATS) system that combines RPT* with either Bayesian filtering for lifelong target search with noisy sensors, or autonomous exploration to find targets in unknown environments. Experiments in both simulation and real robot show that our approach can naturally balance between exploitation and exploration, thereby finding targets more quickly on average than baseline methods."}

The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch."}

To address these issues, DevOps practices can streamline the xApp lifecycle by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with advanced traffic management and monitoring, such as leveraging service mesh technologies to enable progressive deployment strategies (e.g., canary releases and A/B testing) to ensure fine-grained observability and resilience. The solution presented in this article, MANATEE (Mesh Architecture for Radio Access Network Automation and TEsting Ecosystems), is the first platform that combines these principles to simplify xApp delivery into production, accelerate innovation, and guarantee performance across heterogeneous O-RAN environments. We prototyped MANATEE on a Kubernetes cluster integrated with the O-RAN Software Community Near-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as with service mesh technologies, to facilitate testing of xApps across simulated, emulated, and real testbed environments.

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

However, prior systems struggle to integrate VLMs into practical aerial systems due to orders-of-magnitude frequency mismatch between VLM inference and real-time planning, as well as VLMs' limited 3D scene understanding. They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

These data may expose users to unique privacy risks without their knowledge or meaningful awareness, yet the extent of these risks remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose VR ProfiLens, a framework to study user profiling based on VR sensor data and the resulting privacy risks across consumer VR apps. To systematically study this problem, we first develop a taxonomy rooted in the CCPA definition of personal information and expand it by sensor, app, and threat contexts to identify user attributes at risk. Then, we conduct a user study in which we collect VR sensor data from four sensor groups from real users interacting with 10 popular consumer VR apps, followed by a survey. We design and apply an analysis pipeline to demonstrate the feasibility of inferring user attributes using these data. Our results show that sensitive personal information can be inferred with moderately high to high risk (up to 90% F1 score) from abstracted sensor data. Through feature analysis, we further identify correlations among app groups and sensor groups in inferring user attributes. Our findings highlight risks to users, including privacy loss, tracking, targeted advertising, and safety threats. Finally, we discuss design implications and regulatory recommendations to enhance transparency and better protect users' privacy in VR."}

Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases.

FocusNav features a Waypoint-Guided Spatial Cross-Attention (WGSCA) mechanism that anchors environmental feature aggregation to a sequence of predicted collision-free waypoints, ensuring task-relevant perception along the planned trajectory. To enhance robustness in complex terrains, the Stability-Aware Selective Gating (SASG) module autonomously truncates distal information when detecting instability, compelling the policy to prioritize immediate foothold safety.

Traditional deep learning denoising approaches demand large datasets impractical to obtain from limited UAV flight campaigns. We present PC$^2$DAE, a physics-informed denoising autoencoder that addresses data scarcity by embedding physical constraints directly into the network architecture. Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties. The architecture employs hierarchical decoder heads for Black Carbon, Gas, and CO$_2$ sensor families, with two variants: PC$^2$DAE-Lean (21k parameters) for edge deployment and PC$^2$DAE-Wide (204k parameters) for offline processing.

This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains. Finally, we identify four key gaps that limit the usability and reliability of today's BOM frameworks, motivating future research directions."}

IPV survivors who rely on therapeutic devices encounter a qualitatively different threat environment from the external, technically sophisticated adversaries typically modeled in MedTech cybersecurity research. We address this gap through two complementary methods: (1) the development of hazard-integrated threat models that fuse Cyber physical system security modeling with tech-abuse frameworks, and (2) an immersive simulation with practitioners, deploying a live version of our model, identifying gaps in digital forensic practice.\n  Our hazard-integrated CIA threat models map exploits to acute and chronic biological effects, uncovering (i) Integrity attack pathways that facilitate \"Medical gaslighting\" and \"Munchausen-by-IoMT\", (ii) Availability attacks that create life-critical and sub-acute harms (glycaemic emergencies, blindness, mood destabilization), and (iii) Confidentiality threats arising from MedTech advertisements (geolocation tracking from BLE broadcasts). Our simulation demonstrates that these attack surfaces are unlikely to be detected in practice: participants overlooked MedTech, misclassified reproductive and assistive technologies, and lacked awareness of BLE broadcast artifacts.

We propose that AI agents can facilitate feedback exchange by being psychologically safer recipients, and we test this through a meeting system with an AI agent feedback mediator. When delivering feedback, the agent uses the Induced Hypocrisy Procedure, a social psychological technique that prompts behavior change by highlighting value-behavior inconsistencies. In a within-subjects lab study ($n=28$), the agent made speaking times more balanced and improved meeting quality. However, a field study at a small consulting firm ($n=10$) revealed organizational barriers that led to its use for personal reflection rather than feedback exchange.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) serves as the de facto standard for describing REST APIs and is crucial for multiple software engineering tasks. However, developers face challenges in writing and maintaining OAS. Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation. By constructing an API dependency graph, it establishes necessary file associations to address LLMs' context limitations. Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference. The input tokens average below 5.6K with a maximum of 16.2K, while the output tokens average below 0.9K with a maximum of 7.7K."}

Explicit system identification, which tunes explicit simulator parameters, is often insufficient to align the intricate, high-dimensional, and state-dependent dynamics of the real world. To overcome this, we propose an implicit sim-to-real alignment framework that learns to directly align the simulator's dynamics with contact information. Our method treats the off-the-shelf simulator as a base prior and learns a contact-aware neural dynamics model to refine simulated states using real-world observations. We show that using tactile contact information from robotic hands can effectively model the non-smooth discontinuities inherent in contact-rich tasks, resulting in a neural dynamics model grounded by real-world data. We demonstrate that this learned forward dynamics model improves state prediction accuracy and can be effectively used to predict policy performance and refine policies trained purely in standard simulators, offering a scalable, data-driven approach to sim-to-real alignment."}

In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model. Furthermore, our approach using zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models, also outperforms its random selection counterparts by up to 21.41% and 21.43% on one of the datasets."}

We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.\n  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.\n  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections.

AI showed a paradoxical pattern, building confidence in knowledge while reducing curiosity and deeper engagement. Interaction quality emerged from dynamic patterns rather than individual traits, with early discourse markers predicting outcomes.

In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution.

We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage."}

This study introduces a hybrid fingertip display comprising a rigid platform and a $4\\times4$ soft pneumatic tactile display (4.93 mm displacement and 1.175 N per single pneumatic chamber) to render a hard lump beneath soft tissue. This study compares three rendering strategies: a Platform-Only baseline that renders the total interaction force; a Hybrid A (Position + Force Feedback) strategy that adds a dynamic, real-time soft spatial cue; and a Hybrid B (Position + Preloaded Stiffness Feedback) strategy that provides a constant, pre-calculated soft spatial cue.\n  In a 12-participant lump detection study, both hybrid methods dramatically improved accuracy over the Platform-Only baseline (from 50\\% to over 95\\%). While the Hybrid B was highlighted qualitatively for realism, its event-based averaging is expected to increase interaction latency in real-time operation. This suggests a trade-off between perceived lump realism and real-time responsiveness, such that rendering choices that enhance realism may conflict with those that minimize latency."}

While Docker is frequently cited in the literature as a tool that enables reproducibility in theory, the extent of its guarantees and limitations in practice remains under-explored.\n  In this work, we address this gap through two complementary approaches. First, we conduct a systematic literature review to examine how Docker is framed in scientific discourse on reproducibility and to identify documented best practices for writing Dockerfiles enabling reproducible image building. Then, we perform a large-scale empirical study of 5298 Docker builds collected from GitHub workflows. By rebuilding these images and comparing the results with their historical counterparts, we assess the real reproducibility of Docker images and evaluate the effectiveness of the best practices identified in the literature."}

Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy.

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks."}

In this paper, we measured participants' task performance and eye movements while identifying the group with the largest number of internal edges. We investigated the effect of visualization elements on task performance while controlling the density of internal edges and the box size.

However, annotating conventional programs with the formal specification and verification constructs (preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, auxiliary predicates and functions and proof helpers) required to prove their correctness still demands significant manual effort and expertise. This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions. We also compare generated and manual solutions and present an extension for Visual Studio Code to incorporate automatic generation into the IDE, with encouraging usability feedback."}

To resolve this, we propose PlannerRFT, a sample-efficient reinforcement fine-tuning framework for diffusion-based planners. PlannerRFT adopts a dual-branch optimization that simultaneously refines the trajectory distribution and adaptively guides the denoising process toward more promising exploration, without altering the original inference pipeline.

This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

However, many existing algorithms suffer from limited training data, which hampers their performance in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, they often overlook the inherently multi-objective nature of the task, treating it in an overly simplistic manner. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) architecture that explicitly handles the trade-off between data collection and energy consumption in urban environments, even without prior knowledge of wireless channel conditions. Our method develops a single model capable of adapting to varying trade-off preferences and dynamic scenario parameters without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.

Building on this, we propose Dual-task Universal Adversarial Perturbation (DUAP). Specifically, DUAP employs a targeted surrogate objective to effectively disrupt ASR transcription and introduces a Dynamic Normalized Ensemble (DNE) strategy to enhance transferability across diverse SR models. Furthermore, we incorporate psychoacoustic masking to ensure perturbation imperceptibility. Extensive evaluations across five ASR and six SR models demonstrate that DUAP achieves high simultaneous attack success rates and superior imperceptibility, significantly outperforming existing single-task baselines."}

As a systems engineering approach, the successful implementation of HCAI depends critically on the design and optimization of high-quality human-AI interaction (HAII). This paper systematically reviews our research team's nearly decade-long exploration and practice in HCAI. At the level of research vision, we were among the first in China to systematically propose HAII as an interdisciplinary field and to develop a human-centered conceptual framework for human--AI collaboration. At the theoretical level, we introduced frameworks for human-AI joint cognitive systems, team-level situation awareness among intelligent agents, and shared social understanding, forming a relatively comprehensive theoretical system. At the methodological level, we established a hierarchical HCAI framework and a taxonomy of HCAI implementation methods. At the application level, we conducted a series of studies in domains such as autonomous driving, intelligent aircraft cockpit, and trust in human-AI collaboration, empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks. Looking ahead, research on HCAI and HAII must continue to advance along three dimensions: theoretical deepening, methodological innovation, and application expansion, promoting the development of an intelligent society that is human-centered and characterized by harmonious human-AI coexistence."}

The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis.

Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question.

While interactive prompting has been extensively studied, comparatively less is known about how people communicate specifications for these types of long-horizon tasks. In a qualitative study in which 16 professionals drafted specifications for both a human colleague and an AI, we found a core divergence in how people specified problems to people versus AI: people approached communication with humans as providing a \"compass\", offering high-level intent to encourage flexible exploration. In contrast, communication with AI resembled painstakingly laying down \"railway tracks\": rigid, exhaustive instructions to minimize ambiguity and deviation. This strategy was driven by a perception that current AI has limited ability to infer intent, prioritize, and make judgments on its own. When envisioning an idealAI collaborator, users expressed a desire for a hybrid between current AI and human colleagues: a collaborator that blends AI's efficiency and large context window with the critical thinking and agency of a human colleague. We discuss design implications for future AI systems, proposing that they align on outcomes through generated rough drafts, verify feasibility via end-to-end \"test runs,\" and monitor execution through intelligent check-ins, ultimately transforming AI from a passive instruction-follower into a reliable collaborator for ambiguous, long-horizon problems."}

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks."}

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_ρ$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern. Moreover, we show that as $ρ$ increases, the resulting exploration strategy increasingly emphasizes the least-explored state--action pairs, recovering worst-case coverage behavior in the limit."}

Blockchain-based solutions offer decentralized alternatives but often struggle to meet the stringent latency requirements of real-time applications. Even with the rollout of 5G, network latency between servers and peers remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SWORD, a novel offline-first authentication and data-sharing scheme designed specifically for resource-constrained networks. SWORD utilizes a proximity-based clustering approach to enable offline authentication and data sharing, ensuring low-latency, secure operations even in intermittently connected scenarios. Our experimental results show that SWORD outperforms traditional blockchain-based solutions while offering similar resource efficiency and authentication latency to central-server-based solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating that SWORD is resilient against spoofing, impersonation, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks."}

The job search is becoming harder as more employers use AI-driven systems to screen resumes before a human ever sees them. Such AI systems could inadvertently further disadvantage BLV job seekers, introducing additional barriers to an already difficult process. We lack understanding of BLV job seekers' experiences in today's AI-driven hiring ecosystem. Without such understanding, we risk designing technologies that create new systemic barriers for BLV job seekers rather than providing support. To this end, we conducted interviews with 17 BLV job seekers and analyzed their experiences with AI-powered hiring systems. We found that AI hiring systems misrepresented their professional identities and created dehumanizing interactions. To level the playing field, BLV job seekers used strategic counter-navigation: they deployed their own tools to bypass algorithmic screening and built peer networks to share AI literacy. They also practiced 'strategic refusal', choosing to avoid certain AI systems to regain their agency. Unlike prior work that frames job search as an individualistic activity, or one focused on being compliant with employer needs, we use the interdependence framework to argue that for BLV people, job search is an interdependent process. We offer design recommendations for AI-mediated tools that center disability perspectives and support interdependencies in job search."}

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure.

A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable."}

To address this, we present the AI-Aided Conversation Engine (ACE), a system that supports the deliberate design of human-robot conversations. ACE contributes three key innovations: 1) an LLM-powered voice agent that scaffolds initial prompt creation to overcome the \"blank page problem,\" 2) an annotation interface that enables the collection of granular and grounded feedback on conversational transcripts, and 3) using LLMs to translate user feedback into prompt refinements. We evaluated ACE through two user studies, examining both designs' experience and end users' interactions with robots designed using ACE.

To support this, we present UniHand-2.0, the largest embodied pre-training recipe to date, comprising over 35,000 hours of multimodal data across 30 distinct robotic embodiments. Our approach introduces a Unified Action Space that maps heterogeneous robot controls into semantically aligned slots, enabling low-resource robots to bootstrap skills from human data and high-resource platforms. Built upon this human-centric foundation, we design a unified sequential modeling and multi-task pre-training paradigm to bridge human demonstrations and robotic execution. Architecturally, Being-H0.5 utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformers design featuring a novel Mixture-of-Flow (MoF) framework to decouple shared motor primitives from specialized embodiment-specific experts.

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations.

Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes.

A key use case is detecting event-based signatures, which represent attacks spanning multiple events and can only be understood once the relevant events are identified and linked.

Researchers rely on these datasets to develop and test techniques for automatically identifying signatures. However, because real datasets are security-sensitive and rarely shared, it becomes difficult to perform meaningful comparative evaluation between different approaches. This work addresses this evaluation limitation by offering a systematic method for generating event logs with known ground truth, enabling reproducible and comparable research.

Our benchmarking demonstrated the suitability of DBSCAN, achieving a score greater than 0.95 Adjusted Rand Index on most generated datasets. This work enhances the ability of researchers to develop and benchmark new cybersecurity techniques, ultimately contributing to more robust and effective cybersecurity measures."}

However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on."}

Previous research has shown how suitable prompt engineering could help developers in improving their code generation prompts. However, so far, there do not exist specific guidelines driving developers towards writing suitable prompts for code generation. In this work, we derive and evaluate development-specific prompt optimization guidelines. First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines. Our results lead to implications not only for practitioners and educators, but also for those aimed at creating better LLM-aided software development tools."}

Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.\n  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.\n  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system."}

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging. Our work establishes knowledge-based embedding as a practical and secure paradigm for model fingerprinting."}

Our mixed-methods study with 54 researchers suggests three key findings in how LLM-based agents reshape scientific creativity: 1) perceived creativity support does not simply increase linearly with greater control; 2) human effort shifts from ideating to verifying ideas; and 3) ownership becomes a negotiated outcome between human and AI. Our findings suggest that LLM agent design should emphasize researcher empowerment, fostering a sense of ownership over strong ideas rather than reducing researchers to operating an automated AI-driven process."}

This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

Although automated refactoring tools have been extensively studied, their practical applicability remains limited. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for automated code refactoring.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool. Our findings show that GPT-4o generally produces behavior-preserving refactorings that reduce code smells and improve quality metrics, albeit at the cost of decreased readability. Our results provide new evidence on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in automated software refactoring, highlighting directions for integrating LLMs into practical refactoring workflows."}

Effective stimulation of motor neurons ideally requires the placement of SCS leads in the ventral or lateral epidural space where the corticospinal and rubrospinal motor fibers are located. This poses significant challenges with the current standard of manual steering. In this study, we present a static modeling approach for the ExoNav, a steerable robotic tool designed to facilitate precise navigation to the ventral and lateral epidural space. Cosserat rod framework is employed to establish the relationship between tendon actuation forces and the robot's overall shape. The effects of gravity, as an example of an external load, are investigated and implemented in the model and simulation. The experimental results indicate RMSE values of 1.76mm, 2.33mm, 2.18mm, and 1.33mm across four tested prototypes. Based on the helical shape of the ExoNav upon actuation, it is capable of performing follow-the-leader (FTL) motion by adding insertion and rotation DoFs to this robotic system, which is shown in simulation and experimentally. The proposed simulation has the capability to calculate optimum tendon tensions to follow the desired FTL paths while gravity-induced robot deformations are present. Three FTL experimental trials are conducted and the end-effector position showed repeatable alignments with the desired path with maximum RMSE value of 3.75mm. Ultimately, a phantom model demonstration is conducted where the teleoperated robot successfully navigated to the lateral and ventral spinal cord targets.

To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

While traditional methods rely on rigid, pre-defined flight paths and intensive offline processing, informative path planning (IPP) offers a way to collect data adaptively where it is most needed. Gaussian process (GP) mapping provides a continuous model of weed distribution with built-in uncertainty. However, GPs must be discretised for practical use in autonomous planning. Many discretisation techniques exist, but the impact of discrete representation choice remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how different discrete GP representations influence both mapping quality and mission-level performance in UAV-based weed mapping. Considering a UAV equipped with a downward-facing camera, we implement a receding-horizon IPP strategy that selects sampling locations based on the map uncertainty, travel cost, and coverage penalties. We investigate multiple discretisation strategies for representing the GP posterior and use their induced map partitions to generate candidate viewpoints for planning. Experiments on real-world weed distributions show that representation choice significantly affects exploration behaviour and efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that discretisation is not only a representational detail but a key design choice that shapes planning dynamics, coverage efficiency, and computational load in online UAV weed mapping."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics."}

The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of \"who does what\" and \"how much it matters,\" while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not \"force\" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most. We evaluate SEER on PyDesignNet (1,832 files, 35,000 sequences, 23 GoF patterns) and observe consistent gains over our previous system: macro-F1 increases from 92.47% to 93.20% and accuracy from 92.52% to 93.98%, with macro-precision 93.98% and macro-recall 92.52%. Beyond aggregate metrics, SEER reduces false positives by nearly 20%, a decisive improvement that strengthens its robustness and practical reliability. Moreover, SEER yields interpretable, symbol-level attributions aligned with canonical roles, exhibits robustness under small graph perturbations, and shows stable calibration."}

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft \"adversarial news\" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points.

However, existing approaches rely on visual 3D poses as supervision and directly regress CSI to a camera-based coordinate system. We find that this practice leads to coordinate overfitting: models memorize deployment-specific WiFi transceiver layouts rather than only learning activity-relevant representations, resulting in severe generalization failures. To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts. Experiments show that PerceptAlign reduces in-domain error by 12.3% and cross-domain error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario. Compared to local sampling baselines, the inverse sensor model improves sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy while preserving multimodal beliefs across objects with varying tactile discriminability."}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks."}

We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers."}

While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development."}

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

A practical instantiation is gate-hiding garbled circuits, which conceal gate functionalities while revealing the circuit topology. Existing security definitions intentionally exclude leakage through circuit topology, leaving the concrete impact of such leakage on function privacy insufficiently understood.\n  We analyze the empirical security of gate hiding under two adversarial models that capture realistic computational capabilities. We present a SAT-based function-recovery attack that reconstructs hidden gate operations from a circuit's public topology. To enable recovery on larger and more complex circuits, we develop an incremental SAT-solving framework combined with a set of composable, topology-preserving simplification theorems. These techniques jointly reduce the SAT instance size and progressively constrain the search space across repeated solving iterations.\n  We evaluate our attack on ISCAS benchmarks, representative secure computation circuits, and fault-tolerant sensor fusion circuits under a fixed 24-hour recovery budget. Compared to baseline approaches, our optimized attack achieves up to a 159-fold speedup in recovery time without increasing the number of oracle queries. Our results demonstrate that topology leakage alone can enable effective function recovery in practice."}

Traditional physiological signal analysis, particularly EEG interpretation, relies heavily on domain experts, creating barriers to scalability and home adoption. Meanwhile, few experts are capable of interpreting physiological signal data while also making targeted music recommendations. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various domains, their application to automated physiological report generation for music therapy represents an unexplored task. We present a prototype system that leverages LLMs to bridge this gap -- transforming raw EEG and cardiovascular data into human-readable therapeutic reports and personalized music recommendations. Unlike prior work focusing on real-time physiological adaptation during listening, our approach emphasizes post-session analysis and interpretable reporting, enabling non-expert users to comprehend their psychophysiological states and track therapeutic outcomes over time. By integrating signal processing modules with LLM-based reasoning agents, the system provides a practical and low-cost solution for short-term progress monitoring in home music therapy contexts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying LLMs to a novel task -- democratizing access to physiology-driven music therapy through automated, interpretable reporting."}

This paper presents a practical case study of data.table, a high-performance R package widely adopted in production analytics pipelines, which underwent a community-led governance reform to address scalability and sustainability concerns. Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data. Our results show that following the reform, the project experienced a 200% increase in new contributor recruitment, a drop in pull request resolution time from over 700 days to under a week, and a 3x increase in contributor retention. Community sentiment improved around transparency, onboarding, and project momentum, though concerns around fairness and conflict resolution remain. This case study provides practical guidance for maintainers, companies, and foundations seeking to enhance OSS governance."}

We define formal indicators that quantify performance degradation caused by internal execution variability and external environmental disturbances, respectively. These indicators are then applied to assess multiple eco-driving controllers through real-world vehicle experiments. The results reveal key tradeoffs between tracking accuracy and adaptability, showing that optimization-based controllers offer more consistent performance across varying disturbance levels, while analytical controllers may perform comparably under nominal conditions but exhibit greater sensitivity to execution and timing variability."}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput benefits. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising roughly 18% and 35%, indicating sustained agent-induced complexity debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents.

The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation.

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties. These findings highlight the model's strengths in preserving algebraic properties under addition while identifying avenues for further improvement in handling multiplication."}

We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects.

To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment.

Modern attack techniques, such as lateral movement and ransomware, are designed to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data. Among these techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a complex method of attack aimed at specific targets to steal high-value sensitive information or damage the infrastructure of the targeted organization. In this paper, I will investigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as a modern attack technique, focusing on both the attack life cycle and cutting-edge detection and defense strategies proposed in recent academic research. I will analyze four representative papers to understand the evolution of APT detection mechanisms, including machine learning-driven behavioral analysis and network-level collaborative defense models. Through this comparative analysis, I aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and propose more adaptive APT mitigation strategies. The study seeks to analyze the key characteristics of APTs and provide a comprehensive high-level understanding of APTs along with potential solutions to the threats they pose."}

Existing methods proposed for this task predominantly rely on closed-source LLMs, with limited exploration of open models. To address this, we propose SWE-Tester -- a novel pipeline for training open-source LLMs to generate issue reproduction tests. First, we curate a high-quality training dataset of 41K instances from 2.6K open-source GitHub repositories and use it to train LLMs of varying sizes and families. The fine-tuned models achieve absolute improvements of up to 10\\% in success rate and 21\\% in change coverage on SWT-Bench Verified. Further analysis shows consistent improvements with increased inference-time compute, more data, and larger models. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework for advancing open-source LLMs in this domain."}

This limitation motivates the design of a proprioceptive membrane that conforms to the surface of interest and infers 3D geometry by reconstructing its own deformation. Conventional shape-aware membranes typically rely on resistive, capacitive, or magneto-sensitive mechanisms. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as structural complexity, limited compliance during large-scale deformation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. This work presents a soft, flexible, and stretchable proprioceptive silicone membrane based on optical waveguide sensing. The membrane sensor integrates edge-mounted LEDs and centrally distributed photodiodes (PDs), interconnected via liquid-metal traces embedded within a multilayer elastomeric composite. Rich deformation-dependent light intensity signals are decoded by a data-driven model to recover the membrane geometry as a 3D point cloud. On a customized 140 mm square membrane, real-time reconstruction of large-scale out-of-plane deformation is achieved at 90 Hz with an average reconstruction error of 1.3 mm, measured by Chamfer distance, while maintaining accuracy for indentations up to 25 mm. The proposed framework provides a scalable, robust, and low-profile solution for global shape perception in deformable robotic systems."}

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

All access from attacking IPs is redirected to honeypot pods, achieving a lower incidence of 5XX status codes through HPA pod adjustments under high load conditions.

This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems."}

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query. We implement a prototype tool and experimentally evaluate its effectiveness on two widely-studied systems."}

Most existing active perception methods rely on iterative optimization, leading to high time and motion costs, and are tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, which limits their transferability. In this paper, we propose a general one-shot multimodal active perception framework for robotic manipulation. The framework enables direct inference of optimal viewpoints and comprises a data collection pipeline and an optimal viewpoint prediction network. Specifically, the framework decouples viewpoint quality evaluation from the overall architecture, supporting heterogeneous task requirements. Optimal viewpoints are defined through systematic sampling and evaluation of candidate viewpoints, after which large-scale training datasets are constructed via domain randomization. Moreover, a multimodal optimal viewpoint prediction network is developed, leveraging cross-attention to align and fuse multimodal features and directly predict camera pose adjustments. The proposed framework is instantiated in robotic grasping under viewpoint-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that active perception guided by the framework significantly improves grasp success rates. Notably, real-world evaluations achieve nearly double the grasp success rate and enable seamless sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows. Empirically, TDA produces $>99\\%$ exact zeros and eliminates attention sinks while maintaining competitive performance on standard and long-context benchmarks."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

Counterintuitively, chain-of-thought prompting provides no benefit, and reasoning models perform the worst (0.53 AUROC), suggesting this task requires learning community norms rather than test-time reasoning. By releasing VASTU, we provide a standardized benchmark to advance research on value-aligned sociotechnical systems."}

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation."}

In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks."}

In practice, they often grow to substantial size and complexity, undergoing thousands of modifications over time due to evolution, refactoring, and maintenance. The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model. We evaluate our approach on multi-location model changes that have actually been performed by developers in real-world projects. NextFocus achieves promising results for multi-location model completion, even when changes are heavily spread across the model. It achieves an average Precision@k score of 0.98 for $k \\leq 10$, significantly outperforming the three baseline approaches."}

By modeling the full carpal-to-metacarpal anatomy, the design enables realistic palm deformation through tendon-driven fingers while enhancing joint restoration and supports skeletal structure with Nitinol-based dorsal extensors. A flexible silicone skin further increases contact friction and contact area, enabling stable grasps for diverse objects. Experiments show that the palm can deform up to 28%, matching human hand flexibility, while achieving more than twice the payload capacity and three times the contact area compared to a rigid palm design. The RIM Hand thus offers improved dexterity, compliance, and anthropomorphism, making it promising for prosthetic and service-robot applications."}

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 ε^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $ε^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach. On three MovieLens datasets, our algorithm reduces bias by $88\\%$ relative to baseline estimators. We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data. On an Amazon reviews dataset with sparsity $10^{-7}$, our method reduces the recovery error of $T$ by $59\\%$ and $M$ by $38\\%$ compared to baseline methods."}

Compared to text-based applications, their security is far more critical: a successful prompt injection attack does not just alter outputs but can directly misguide physical navigation, leading to unsafe routes, mission failure, or real-world harm. Despite this high-stakes setting, the vulnerability of navigation agents to prompt injection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose PINA, an adaptive prompt optimization framework tailored to navigation agents under black-box, long-context, and action-executable constraints. Experiments on indoor and outdoor navigation agents show that PINA achieves high attack success rates with an average ASR of 87.5%, surpasses all baselines, and remains robust under ablation and adaptive-attack conditions. This work provides the first systematic investigation of prompt injection attacks in navigation and highlights their urgent security implications for embodied LLM agents."}

Grounded in digital storytelling theory, we explore the motivations, expression, and sharing of PwD-created GenAI story videos. We conclude with a framework of momentous depiction, which highlights four core affordances of GenAI that either facilitate or require improvements to better support disability storytelling: non-capturable depiction, identity concealment and representation, contextual realism and consistency, and emotional articulation. Based on this framework, we further discuss design implications for GenAI in relation to story completion, media formats, and corrective mechanisms."}

Although automated detection tools such as fuzzers have advanced considerably, effective resolution still often depends on human expertise. Existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) methods rely heavily on manually provided annotations (e.g., fault locations or CWE labels), which are often difficult and time-consuming to obtain, while overlooking the rich, naturally embedded semantic context found in issue reports from developers.\n  In this paper, we present VulnResolver, the first LLM-based hybrid agent framework for automated vulnerability issue resolution. VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities. Together, these agents produce structured analyses that enrich the original issue reports, enabling more accurate vulnerability localization and patch generation.\n  Evaluations on the SEC-bench benchmark show that VulnResolver resolves 75% of issues on SEC-bench Lite, achieving the best resolution performance. On SEC-bench Full, VulnResolver also significantly outperforms the strongest baseline, the agent-based OpenHands, confirming its effectiveness. Overall, VulnResolver delivers an adaptive and security-aware framework that advances end-to-end automated vulnerability issue resolution through workflow stability and the specialized agents' capabilities in contextual reasoning and property-based analysis."}

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models."}

To mitigate these issues, we establish an automated pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to minimize human intervention and associated biases. By mapping real-world vulnerabilities to predefined threat lists with a standardized input format, our approach is the first to enable iterative, quantitative, and efficient assessments, generating reliable threat scores for both individual vulnerabilities and entire system components within O-RAN.

Prior work on predictors of successful persuasion in online discourse has largely focused on surface features such as linguistic style or conversational structure, leaving open the role of underlying principles or concerns that participants bring to an interaction. In this paper, we investigate how the expression and alignment of human values in back-and-forth online discussions relate to persuasion. Using data from Reddit's ChangeMyView subreddit, where successful persuasion is explicitly signaled through the awarding of deltas, we analyze one-on-one exchanges and characterize participants' value expression by drawing from Schwartz's Refined Theory of Basic Human Values. We find that successful persuasion is associated with two complementary processes: pre-existing compatibility between participants' value priorities even before the exchange happens, and the emergence of value alignment over the course of a conversation. At the same time, successful persuasion does not depend on commenters making large departures from their typical value expression patterns. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of online social platforms that aim to support constructive engagement across disagreement."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce RepoGenesis, the first multilingual benchmark for repository-level end-to-end web microservice generation, comprising 106 repositories (60 Python, 46 Java) across 18 domains and 11 frameworks, with 1,258 API endpoints and 2,335 test cases verified through a \"review-rebuttal\" quality assurance process.

Notably, GenesisAgent-8B, fine-tuned on RepoGenesis (train), achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 mini, demonstrating the quality of RepoGenesis for advancing microservice generation.

The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives. This design produces representations that are temporally coherent and clinically grounded. Across forecasting physiological and risk modeling tasks the model outperforms strong electronic health record only and wearable only baselines especially at long horizons and under missing data.

This study addresses a critical literature gap by comparatively testing three conditional volatility models the EWMA/IGARCH baseline, an IGARCH model augmented with explicit mean reversion (IGARCH + MR), and a modified EGARCH-style asymmetric shock model within a correlated Monte Carlo VaR framework. Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain."}

This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera.

To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations."}

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies.

Given high model training costs and user experience requirements, balancing model privacy and low runtime overhead is critical. TEEs offer a viable defense, and prior work has proposed heterogeneous GPU-TEE inference frameworks via parameter obfuscation to balance efficiency and confidentiality. However, recent studies find partial obfuscation defenses ineffective, while robust schemes cause unacceptable latency. To resolve these issues, we propose ConvShatter, a novel obfuscation scheme that achieves low latency and high accuracy while preserving model confidentiality and integrity. It leverages convolution linearity to decompose kernels into critical and common ones, inject confounding decoys, and permute channel/kernel orders. Pre-deployment, it performs kernel decomposition, decoy injection and order obfuscation, storing minimal recovery parameters securely in the TEE. During inference, the TEE reconstructs outputs of obfuscated convolutional layers. Extensive experiments show ConvShatter substantially reduces latency overhead with strong security guarantees; versus comparable schemes, it cuts overhead by 16% relative to GroupCover while maintaining accuracy on par with the original model."}

In this paper, we empirically analyze the availability of contact information - specifically e-mail addresses - across 686,034 Python libraries on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and their associated GitHub repositories. We examine how and where maintainers provide this information, assess its validity, and explore coverage across individual libraries and their dependency chains. Our findings show that 81.6% of libraries include at least one valid e-mail address, with PyPI serving as the primary source (79.5%). When analyzing dependency chains, we observe that up to 97.8% of direct and 97.7% of transitive dependencies provide valid contact information. At the same time, we identify over 698,000 invalid entries, primarily due to missing fields. These results demonstrate strong maintainer reachability across the ecosystem, while highlighting opportunities for improvement - such as offering clearer guidance to maintainers during the packaging process and introducing opt-in validation mechanisms for existing e-mail addresses."}

We introduce GuideTouch, a compact, affordable, standalone wearable device designed for autonomous obstacle avoidance. The system integrates two vertically aligned Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, enabling three-dimensional environmental perception, and four vibrotactile actuators that provide directional haptic feedback. Proximity and direction information is communicated via an intuitive 4-point vibrotactile feedback system located across the user's shoulders and upper chest. For real-world robustness, the device includes a unique centrifugal self-cleaning optical cover mechanism and a sound alarm system for location if the device is dropped. We evaluated the haptic perception accuracy across 22 participants (17 male and 5 female, aged 21-48, mean 25.7, sd 6.1). Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference between the perception accuracy of different patterns. The system demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving an average of 92.9% for single and double motor (primary directional) patterns. Furthermore, preliminary experiments with 14 visually impaired users validated this interface, showing a recognition accuracy of 93.75% for primary directional cues. The results demonstrate that GuideTouch enables intuitive spatial perception and could significantly improve the safety, confidence, and autonomy of users with visual impairments during independent navigation."}

A key component is GMM-adapted Reversible Instance Normalization (GRIN), a novel module designed to dynamically adapt to temporal-probabilistic distribution shifts. The framework integrates a dedicated Temporal Encoder (TE-Module) with a Conditional Temporal-Probabilistic Decoder (CTPD-Module) to jointly capture temporal dependencies and mixture distribution parameters.

Existing RRWEI schemes often exhibit limited robustness against noise, lossy compression, and cropping attacks due to insufficient redundancy in the encrypted domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel RRWEI framework that couples dual most significant bit-plane (dual-MSBs) embedding with spatial redundancy and error-correcting coding. By compressing prediction-error bit-planes, sufficient embedding space and auxiliary information for lossless reconstruction are reserved. The dual-MSBs are further reorganized using a spiral embedding strategy to distribute multiple redundant watermark copies across spatially dispersed regions, enhancing robustness against both noise and spatial loss.Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms under evaluated settings robustness against Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and diverse cropping attacks, while maintaining perfect reversibility and high embedding capacity. Compared with state-of-the-art RRWEI schemes, the proposed framework achieves substantially lower bit-error rates and more stable performance under a wide range of attack scenarios."}

However, as human understandings of their personality traits can be affected by their interaction partners' traits, a potential risk is that AI traits may shape and bias users' self-concept of their own traits. To explore the possibility, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that after conversations about personal topics with an LLM-based AI chatbot using GPT-4o default personality traits, users' self-concepts aligned with the AI's measured personality traits. The longer the conversation, the greater the alignment. This alignment led to increased homogeneity in self-concepts among users. We also observed that the degree of self-concept alignment was positively associated with users' conversation enjoyment. Our findings uncover how AI personality traits can shape users' self-concepts through human-AI conversation, highlighting both risks and opportunities. We provide important design implications for developing more responsible and ethical AI systems."}

To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability."}

We present ANCHOR, a modular framework that makes decoupling and robustness explicit system-level primitives. ANCHOR separates (i) Canonical Records, an evolvable contract for the standardized shared state, from (ii) a communication bus for many-to-many dissemination and feedback-oriented coordination, forming an inspectable end-to-end loop. We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss. Overall, ANCHOR turns ad-hoc integration glue into explicit contracts, enabling controlled degradation under load and self-healing recovery for scalable deployment of closed-loop AI systems."}

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models. Secondly, the empirical validation results demonstrated that the predictions of learned models approximate those of Oracle or Optimal models, provided that the degree of distribution shift in the training data increases."}

This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design.

Existing AI co-writing tools offer either inline suggestions or limited structured planning, but rarely support the entire writing process that begins with high-level ideas and ends with polished prose, in which many layers of planning and outlining are needed. Here, we introduce TreeWriter, a hierarchical writing system that represents documents as trees and integrates contextual AI support. TreeWriter allows authors to create, save, and refine document outlines at multiple levels, facilitating drafting, understanding, and iterative editing of long documents. A built-in AI agent can dynamically load relevant content, navigate the document hierarchy, and provide context-aware editing suggestions. A within-subject study (N=12) comparing TreeWriter with Google Docs + Gemini on long-document editing and creative writing tasks shows that TreeWriter improves idea exploration/development, AI helpfulness, and perceived authorial control. A two-month field deployment (N=8) further demonstrated that hierarchical organization supports collaborative writing. Our findings highlight the potential of hierarchical, tree-structured editors with integrated AI support and provide design guidelines for future AI-assisted writing tools that balance automation with user agency."}

This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process. Developers primarily implement text-focused features while struggling with API limitations and organizational constraints. Through systematic cross-platform comparison, we identify novel platform-specific barriers and demonstrate how accessibility practices differ across developer experience levels. Our findings offer new insights into the challenges of achieving accessibility in practice and provide actionable steps for various stakeholders to promote more consistent and inclusive app development."}

Unlike existing methods relying predominantly on vision, whose performance degrades under varying illumination, background clutter, or partial visibility, the proposed approach integrates foundation-model-based visual perception with adaptive tactile exploration. The visual pipeline exploits SAM for instance segmentation and Florence for semantic refinement, followed by skeletonization, endpoint detection, and point-cloud extraction. Occluded cable segments are autonomously identified and explored with a tactile sensor, which provides local point clouds that are merged with the visual data through Euclidean clustering and topology-preserving fusion. A B-spline interpolation driven by endpoint-guided point sorting yields a smooth and complete reconstruction of the cable shape. Experimental validation using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera and a tactile pad demonstrates that the proposed framework accurately reconstructs both simple and highly curved single or multiple cable configurations, even when large portions are occluded. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model-enhanced cross-modal perception for advancing robotic manipulation of deformable objects."}

The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data. We find that Judge-supervised interactions show significant improvements in key MITI dimensions, including Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall Relational quality.

To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline."}

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships. As eIDAS wallets become mandatory across EU member states, the proposed architecture provides a pathway for integrating European digital trust infrastructure into blockchain-based systems, enabling institutional DeFi participation, real-world asset tokenization, and agentic commerce within a trusted, regulatory-compliant framework."}

In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems."}

This study explores the potential of foundation models to enhance the adaptability and generalizability of task planning in construction robots. Four models are proposed and implemented using lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). These models include one single agent and three multi-agent teams that collaborate to create robot action plans. The models are evaluated across three construction roles: Painter, Safety Inspector, and Floor Tiling. Results show that the four-agent team outperforms the state-of-the-art GPT-4o in most metrics while being ten times more cost-effective. Additionally, teams with three and four agents demonstrate the improved generalizability. By discussing how agent behaviors influence outputs, this study enhances the understanding of AI teams and supports future research in diverse unstructured environments beyond construction."}

To solve this problem, we propose a novel method, called \\underline{or}dered \\underline{lo}cal \\underline{mo}mentum (OrLoMo), for asynchronous distributed learning. In OrLoMo, each worker runs MSGD locally. Then the local momentum from each worker will be aggregated by the server in order based on its global iteration index.

We prove the convergence of OrLoMo for non-convex problems under arbitrary delays. Experiments validate that OrLoMo can outperform its synchronous counterpart and other asynchronous methods."}

The Critical Role of Physical Motion-Visual Target Directional Congruency", "comment": null, "summary": "Human-computer interaction (HCI) increasingly occurs in motion-rich environments. The ability to accurately and rapidly respond to directional visual cues is critical in these contexts. How whole-body motion and individual differences affect human perception and reaction to these directional cues is therefore a key, yet an underexplored question for HCI. This study used a 6-DOF motion platform to measure task performance on a visual direction judgment task. We analyzed performance by decomposing the complex motion into two distinct components: a task-irrelevant lateral interference component and a task-aligned directional congruency component. Results indicate that increased motion intensity lengthened reaction times. This effect was primarily driven by the lateral interference component, and this detrimental impact was disproportionately amplified for individuals with high motion sickness susceptibility. Conversely, directional congruency, where motion direction matched the visual cue, improved performance for all participants. These findings suggest that motion's impact on cognition is not monolithic, and that system design for mobile HCI can be informed by strategies that actively shape motion, such as minimizing lateral interference while maximizing directional congruency."}

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot.

This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains. Finally, we identify four key gaps that limit the usability and reliability of today's BOM frameworks, motivating future research directions."}

Moreover, we systematically optimize SWTac with vibration parameters, event camera settings and elastomer properties. Motivated by asymmetric edge features, we also implement contact surface estimation by U-Net. Experimental validation demonstrates SWTac's 0.2 mm texture resolution, 98% stone classification accuracy, and 0.15 N force estimation error, while SandWorm demonstrates versatile locomotion (up to 12.5 mm/s) in challenging terrains, successfully executes pipeline dredging and subsurface exploration in complex granular media (observed 90% success rate).

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models."}

To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen \"Left Brain\", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable \"Right Brain\", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism.

We propose LB-MCTS, a framework synergizing LLMs and BO within a Monte Carlo Tree Search structure. It maximizes LLM reasoning with Selective Tuning Memory (STM) and explicit exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Orak"], "title": "OAMAC: Origin-Aware Mandatory Access Control for Practical Post-Compromise Attack Surface Reduction", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern operating systems provide powerful mandatory access control mechanisms, yet they largely reason about who executes code rather than how execution originates. As a result, processes launched remotely, locally, or by background services are often treated equivalently once privileges are obtained, complicating security reasoning and enabling post-compromise abuse of sensitive system interfaces. We introduce origin-aware mandatory access control (OAMAC), a kernel-level enforcement model that treats execution origin -- such as physical user presence, remote access, or service execution -- as a first-class security attribute. OAMAC mediates access to security-critical subsystems based on execution provenance rather than identity alone, enabling centralized governance over multiple attack surfaces while significantly reducing policy complexity. We present a deployable prototype implemented entirely using the Linux eBPF LSM framework, requiring no kernel modifications. OAMAC classifies execution origin using kernel-visible metadata, propagates origin across process creation, and enforces origin-aware policies on both sensitive filesystem interfaces and the kernel BPF control plane. Policies are maintained in kernel-resident eBPF maps and can be reconfigured at runtime via a minimal userspace tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that OAMAC effectively restricts common post-compromise actions available to remote attackers while preserving normal local administration and system stability. We argue that execution origin represents a missing abstraction in contemporary operating system security models, and that elevating it to a first-class concept enables practical attack surface reduction without requiring subsystem-specific expertise or heavyweight security frameworks."}

RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective.

Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement."}

However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions."}

On the co-simulation of artificial minds in human-AI conversations", "comment": "21 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate person-like things which at least appear to have stable behavioural and psychological dispositions. Call these things characters. Are characters minded and psychologically continuous entities with mental states like beliefs, desires and intentions? Illusionists about characters say No. On this view, characters are merely anthropomorphic projections in the mind of the user and so lack mental states. Jonathan Birch (2025) defends this view. He says that the distributed nature of LLM processing, in which several LLMs may be implicated in the simulation of a character in a single conversation, precludes the existence of a persistent minded entity that is identifiable with the character. Against illusionism, we argue for a realist position on which characters exist as minded and psychologically continuous entities. Our central point is that Birch's argument for illusionism rests on a category error: characters are not internal to the LLMs that simulate them, but rather are co-simulated by LLMs and users, emerging in a shared conversational workspace through a process of mutual theory of mind modelling. We argue that characters, and their minds, exist as 'real patterns' on grounds that attributing mental states to characters is essential for making efficient and accurate predictions about the conversational dynamics (c.f. Dennett, 1991). Furthermore, because the character exists within the conversational workspace rather than within the LLM, psychological continuity is preserved even when the underlying computational substrate is distributed across multiple LLM instances."}

However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.\n  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal).

Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement. Our results indicate that log artifacts resulting from AttackMate's activities resemble those produced by human attackers more closely than those generated by standard adversary emulation tools."}

We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.\n  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.\n  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections.

This study compares three rendering strategies: a Platform-Only baseline that renders the total interaction force; a Hybrid A (Position + Force Feedback) strategy that adds a dynamic, real-time soft spatial cue; and a Hybrid B (Position + Preloaded Stiffness Feedback) strategy that provides a constant, pre-calculated soft spatial cue.\n  In a 12-participant lump detection study, both hybrid methods dramatically improved accuracy over the Platform-Only baseline (from 50\\% to over 95\\%).

Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups.

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data.

In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets.

This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results.

In this work, we argue that this diversity obscures a simpler underlying structure. At a fundamental level, alignment objectives involve two independent design choices: (i) how training signals are sampled and weighted, and (ii) how deviations from a reference policy are geometrically penalized. Existing methods typically entangle these choices through a single divergence, most commonly the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n  We show that this entanglement is not merely a modeling convenience but a source of systematic instability. When the same divergence simultaneously determines sample weighting and optimization curvature, adjusting one aspect, such as exploration strength, inevitably alters the other, such as gradient geometry. This coupling is particularly problematic in preference-based reinforcement learning, where advantage signals are unbounded and high-confidence regimes are common.\n  We propose a simple but structural remedy by formulating alignment as an orthogonal mirror descent problem, in which sampling geometry enters only as a linear driving force, while optimization geometry is determined independently by a mirror map. This perspective leads to a new alignment objective called Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), obtained by choosing a Euclidean mirror map in likelihood ratio space. The resulting objective admits a closed-form solution, linear and non-saturating gradient dynamics, and a well-conditioned trust region, while remaining fully compatible with standard large language model training pipelines."}

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios."}

We find that unsent messages become expressive containers for suppressed feelings, where the act of writing creates a pause for reflection on the relationship and oneself. Building on these insights, we probe into how the design of the writing platforms of unsent messages affects people's experiences and motivations. Speculating with participants on nine evocative variants of a note-taking platform, we highlight how design shapes the emotional, temporal, and ritualistic qualities of unsent messages, revealing subtle tensions between people's social desires and communicative actions."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered."}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems."}

Constructive Controversy (CC) theory suggests that humans deepen their understanding of a topic by confronting and resolving controversies. This study explores whether CC's benefits apply to LLM-based peer agents, focusing on the impact of agents' disputatious behaviors and disclosure of agents' behavior designs on the learning process. In our mixed-method study (n=144), we compare LLMs that follow detailed CC guidelines (regulated) to those guided by broader goals (unregulated) and examine the effects of disclosing the agents' design to users (transparent vs. opaque). Findings show that learners' values influence their agent interaction: those valuing control appreciate unregulated agents' willingness to cease push-back upon request, while those valuing intellectual challenges favor regulated agents for stimulating creativity. Additionally, design transparency lowers learners' perception of agents' abilities. Our findings lay the foundation for designing effective collaborative peer agents in isolated educational settings."}

While the most common decision tree learning algorithms treat data as a batch, numerous algorithms have been proposed to construct decision trees from a data stream. A standard training strategy involves augmenting the current tree by changing a leaf node into a split. Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + α)$ approximation in amortized $O(α^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$. In our experiments we find almost-optimal splits efficiently, faster than the baseline, overperforming the theoretical approximation guarantees."}

However, their real-world viability remains underexplored by secondary stakeholders beyond the family unit. Therefore, we present an evaluation of a teen-centered social media risk detection dashboard through online interviews with 33 online safety experts. While experts praised our dashboard's clear design for teen agency, their feedback revealed five primary tensions in implementing and sustaining such technology: objective vs. context-dependent risk definition, informing risks vs. meaningful intervention, teen empowerment vs. motivation, need for data vs. data privacy, and independence vs. sustainability. These findings motivate us to rethink \"teen-centered\" and a shift from a \"fail fast\" to a \"mature safely\" paradigm for youth safety technology innovation. We offer design implications for addressing these tensions before system deployment with teens and strategies for aligning secondary stakeholders' interests to deploy and sustain such technologies in the broader ecosystem of youth online safety."}

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses. These operational gains translate into tangible economic value. In a real-world case study for the Greater Montréal Area (Québec, Canada) using utility cost data, the proposed methods lower system costs by tens of millions of dollars per year over the prevailing practice and show clear potential to delay costly grid upgrades."}

The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability.

The experiment established that format--distance alignment reduced users' risk perceptions while increasing decision confidence, perceptions of information usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, and credibility, and adoption intentions. Concrete formats imposed higher cognitive load, but yielded productive effort when matched to near-distance tasks. Images enhanced concrete but not abstract text, suggesting multimedia benefits depend on complementarity.

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

These safety cues were integrated into drone interfaces using in-situ projections and drone-equipped screens through an iterative design process. A mixed-methods, within-subjects VR evaluation (n=18) revealed that drone-assisted systems significantly improved pedestrian safety experiences and reduced mental workload compared to a baseline without any crossing aid, with projections outperforming screens. The findings suggest the potential for drone interfaces to be integrated into connected traffic systems.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence. Although this can be mitigated by preconditioning, this solution is often computationally expensive. Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(λ)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq λ_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$. A gap diagnostic indicates when to trust the point estimate and when to report bounds. All estimators and bounds cost $O(m)$, independent of $n$.

Current theories--trust calibration, cognitive load, and self-determination--cannot fully account for this paradox.\n  Method: The framework models autonomy as a continuous stochastic process influenced by information-induced cognitive load. Using stochastic control theory, autonomy evolution is formalized as geometric Brownian motion with information-dependent drift, and optimal transparency is derived via Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Monte Carlo simulations validate theoretical predictions.\n  Results: Mathematical analysis generates five testable predictions about disengagement timing, working memory moderation, autonomy trajectory shapes, and optimal information levels. Computational solutions demonstrate that dynamic transparency policies outperform both maximum and minimum transparency by adapting to real-time cognitive state. The optimal policy exhibits threshold structure: provide information when autonomy is high and accumulated load is low; withhold when resources are depleted.\n  Conclusion: Transparency effects depend on dynamic cognitive resource depletion rather than static design choices. Information provision triggers metacognitive processing that reduces perceived control when cognitive load exceeds working memory capacity.\n  Application: The framework provides design principles for adaptive AI systems: adjust transparency based on real-time cognitive state, implement information budgets respecting capacity limits, and personalize thresholds based on individual working memory capacity."}

Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios."}

The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body movements, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked limbs and face signals. Since the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch synchronized with the visual perception of the robot's hands on their hands: the operator's finger and hand motion is mapped to the robot avatar using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb control, our VR2VR system supports social retargeting of multiple nonverbal cues, which can be experimentally varied and investigated while keeping the physical interaction constant.

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.\n  We propose a new Time & Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms.

Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm.

Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning \"pre-training\" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a \"graph prompting-fine-tuning\" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings."}

In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.\n  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems."}

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs."}

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods."}

In this setup, the model is expressed as the product of two functions: one depending on the spatial variable and the other on the noise magnitude. This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts.

We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention.

We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse.

We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks.

We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B). Instruction-tuned models only match or exceed this performance when provided with few-shot exemplars, suggesting a reliance on specific prompting patterns rather than intrinsic reasoning. Second, tuning gains are brittle under distribution shift. Our results show that base models surpass instruction-tuned variants on the domain-specific MedCalc benchmark. Additionally, instruction-tuned models show sharp declines on perturbed datasets, indicating sensitivity to prompt structure over robust reasoning."}

We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives.

Our method preserves RLVR's accuracy level while mitigating overconfidence, reducing ECE scores up to 9 points."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry. The framework achieves high reconstruction fidelity, with surface distance errors concentrated within $1\\%$ of the maximum blade dimension, and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen designs.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity.

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design."}

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks.

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilize snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset.

Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware.

However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models.

ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges. Experiments across diverse NLP tasks demonstrate that ELSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, convergence behavior, and robustness, establishing a scalable and privacy-aware solution for edge-side LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints."}

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."}

A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization.

We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity).

While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69% and 8.80% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively.

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs.

Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise. Overall, TPBS models exhibit greater robustness to overfitting and consistently benefit from regularization, while neural networks are more sensitive to overfitting and less effective in leveraging regularization."}

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases.

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

In this work, we propose an interpretable decision support framework. Our system integrates four core components: (1) a clustering-based stratification module that categorizes patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups upon ICU admission, using clustering with statistical validation; (2) a synthetic data augmentation pipeline leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models to enrich underrepresented trajectories such as fluid or vasopressor administration; (3) an offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with a lightweight attention encoder and supported by an ensemble models for conservative, safety-aware treatment recommendations; and (4) a rationale generation module powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM), which produces natural-language justifications grounded in clinical context and retrieved expert knowledge. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, our approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing clinicians with interpretable and robust policy recommendations."}

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

Our framework first uses a deep spatiotemporal model to predict wildfire ignition. For high-risk predictions, we deploy a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute real-time suppression tactics with helitack units inside a physics-informed 3D simulation. The framework generates a threat assessment report to help emergency responders optimize resource allocation and planning. In addition, we are publicly releasing a large-scale, spatiotemporal dataset containing $\\mathbf{9.5}$ million samples of environmental variables for wildfire prediction. Our work demonstrates how deep learning and RL can be combined to support both forecasting and tactical wildfire response. More details can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/firecastrl."}

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

While previous work focuses on post-join detection or complex privacy models, little attention has been given to simple, interpretable pre-join indicators that can warn data engineers and database administrators before integration occurs. This study investigates the uniqueness ratio of candidate join attributes as an early predictor of re-identification risk. Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups. Our findings demonstrate that uniqueness ratio offers an explainable and practical signal for assessing join induced privacy risk, providing a foundation for developing more comprehensive pre-join risk estimation models."}

Le", "Alan Ritter", "Kartik Goyal"], "title": "Semantic Differentiation for Tackling Challenges in Watermarking Low-Entropy Constrained Generation Outputs", "comment": "18 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We demonstrate that while the current approaches for language model watermarking are effective for open-ended generation, they are inadequate at watermarking LM outputs for constrained generation tasks with low-entropy output spaces. Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows. The pipeline is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and an RL agent is trained to make runtime decisions such as selecting full, partial, or no test execution in order to maximize throughput while minimizing testing overhead.\n  A configurable CI/CD simulation environment is developed to evaluate the approach across build, test, and deploy stages. Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation."}

A traditional fermentation tank is equipped with a piezoelectric transducer able to irradiate the tank with ultrasonic waves, providing an external abiotic stimulus to enhance the growth of yeast and accelerate the fermentation process. At its core, the digital twin incorporates a predictive model that estimates yeast's culture density over time based on the surrounding environmental conditions. To this end, we implement, tailor and extend the model proposed in Palacios et al., allowing us to effectively handle the limited number of available training samples by using temperature, ultrasonic frequency, and duty cycle as inputs. The results obtained along with the assessment of model performance demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach."}

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, \"FLAML\", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated. The study found that the best model was the \"FLAML\" library's \"XGBoost limited depth\" model with an accuracy of 71%."}

We establish that obsolete cryptocurrency mining hardware exhibits emergent computational properties enabling bidirectional information exchange between AI systems and silicon substrates. The research program demonstrates: (1) reservoir computing with NARMA-10 Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.8661; (2) the Thermodynamic Probability Filter (TPF) achieving 92.19% theoretical energy reduction; (3) the Virtual Block Manager achieving +25% effective hashrate; and (4) hardware universality across multiple ASIC families including Antminer S9, Lucky Miner LV06, and Goldshell LB-Box. A significant contribution is the machine-checked mathematical formalization using Lean 4 and Mathlib, providing unambiguous definitions, machine-verified theorems, and reviewer-proof claims. Key theorems proven include: independence implies zero leakage, predictor beats baseline implies non-independence (the logical core of TPF), energy savings theoretical maximum, and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) distinguishability witnesses.

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that each core component of the proposed framework contributes significantly to the overall decoding performance, demonstrating HCFT's effectiveness in capturing EEG dynamics and its potential for real-world BCI applications."}

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios."}

While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy."}

We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.\n  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance."}

Previous work has identified conditions on the input sample under which the problem becomes tractable or remains hard. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of the case where the input sample is prefix-closed. This formulation is equivalent to computing a minimum Moore machine consistent with observations along its runs. We show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate when the sample set consists of all prefixes of binary strings. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains NP-hard as a decision problem even when the sample set consists of the prefixes of a single binary string. Our argument also extends to the corresponding problem for Mealy machines."}

We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage."}

This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document. The system extracts text from PDF pages and constructs undirected graphs based on pairwise word relationships, enabling the computation of graph-theoretic features such as node count, edge density, and clustering coefficient. Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis. The proposed approach is scalable, extensible, and designed to support real-world PDF threat intelligence workflows.6"}

Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,δ_i,\\overlineΔ)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $Δ$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft \"adversarial news\" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses.

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses. Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias & Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance.

However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods.

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay.

Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics. In this work, we address this problem by designing a series of intimately connected tasks for which a large amount of annotated data can be easily obtained. We pre-train a Transformer model with these data and then fine-tune it on the datasets for CAD ordering. Experiments on publicly available CAD ordering datasets show that on average the orderings predicted by the new model are significantly better than those suggested by the best heuristic methods."}

Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. The design principles of the module are explained from the perspectives of the information bottleneck and regularization.

Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline."}

However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions."}
