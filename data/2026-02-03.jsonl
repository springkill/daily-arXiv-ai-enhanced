The recent framework of existentially constrained terms and most general constrained rewriting on them (Takahata et al., 2025) has many advantages over the original approach of rewriting constrained terms. In this paper, we introduce partial constrained rewriting, a variant of rewriting existentially constrained terms whose underlying idea has already appeared implicitly in previous analyses and applications of LCTRSs. We examine the differences between these two notions of constrained rewriting. First, we establish a direct correspondence between them, leveraging subsumption and equivalence of constrained terms where appropriate. Then we give characterizations of each of them, using the interpretation of existentially constrained terms by instantiation. We further introduce the novel notion of value interpretation, that highlights subtle differences between partial and most general rewriting."}

LeanArchitect introduces a declarative annotation mechanism that associates formal declarations with blueprint metadata, automatically infers dependency information, and generates $\\LaTeX$ blueprint content synchronized with the Lean development. This design eliminates duplication between formal and informal representations and eases fine-grained progress tracking for both human contributors and AI-based theorem provers. We demonstrate the practicality of LeanArchitect through the automated conversion of several large existing blueprint-driven projects, and through a human--AI collaboration case study formalizing a multivariate Taylor theorem. Our results show that LeanArchitect improves maintainability, exposes latent inconsistencies in existing blueprints, and provides an effective interface for integrating AI tools into real-world formalization workflows."}

Yet, its success depends on two key choices: the geometric parameterization defining the search space and the optimizer exploring it.\n  This study investigates this interplay through a compliance minimization problem for a cantilever beam subject to a connectivity constraint. We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.\n  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency. Overall, this study highlights the dominant role of geometric parameterization in practical BBO-based TO and shows that algorithm performance and selection cannot be fairly assessed without accounting for the induced design space."}

However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics"}

As these marketplaces expand, many candidates become functionally overlapping, making selection not just a retrieval problem: beyond filtering relevant agents, an orchestrator must choose options that are reliable, compatible with the current execution context, and able to cooperate with other selected agents. Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \\textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \\textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \\textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \\textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \\textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \\textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution). To enable systematic evaluation, we construct a unified calling-tree benchmark by normalizing invocation logs from eight heterogeneous multi-agent corpora into a shared structured representation."}

SPARK allows instructors to flexibly group substeps into checkpoints based on exercise requirements, suggests automated tests for these checkpoints, and generates visualizations to track progress across steps. SPARK also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations.

Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals. Action Learning belongs to the French policy that aims to improve the volume and the quality of the contracts between Universities and companies."}

However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal."}

To address this gap, we propose Nethira, a heterogeneity-aware pre-trained model based on hierarchical reconstruction and augmentation. In pre-training, Nethira introduces hierarchical reconstruction at multiple levels-byte, protocol, and packet-capturing comprehensive traffic structural information. During fine-tuning, Nethira proposes a consistency-regularized strategy with hierarchical traffic augmentation to reduce label dependence.

Moreover, prevailing notions of MPMOP optimal solutions are restricted to strictly common Pareto optimal solutions, representing a narrow form of cooperation in multiparty decision making scenarios. These limitations obscure whether a solution set reflects balanced relative gains or meaningful consensus among heterogeneous DMs. To address these issues, this paper develops a fairness-aware performance evaluation framework grounded in a generalized notion of consensus solutions. From a cooperative game-theoretic perspective, we formalize four axioms that a fairness-aware evaluation function for MPMOPs should satisfy. By introducing a concession rate vector to quantify acceptable compromises by individual DMs, we generalize the classical definition of MPMOP optimal solutions and embed classical performance metrics into a Nash-product-based evaluation framework, which is theoretically shown to satisfy all axioms. To support empirical validation, we further construct benchmark problems that extend existing MPMOP suites by incorporating consensus-deficient negotiation structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation framework is able to distinguish algorithmic performance in a manner consistent with consensus-aware fairness considerations. Specifically, algorithms converging toward strictly common solutions are assigned higher evaluation scores when such solutions exist, whereas in the absence of strictly common solutions, algorithms that effectively cover the commonly acceptable region are more favorably evaluated."}

LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods."}

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale."}

High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results."}

We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p < .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report. We propose eight research directions and a design space outlining best practices and pitfalls, offering actionable guidance for robotics education."}

The highly distributed and interdependent nature of modern cloud-based systems often complicates RCA efforts, particularly for multi-hop fault propagation, where symptoms appear far from their true causes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance automated RCA. However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.\n  We present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation. Our results clarify where current open-source LLMs succeed and fail in multi-hop RCA, quantify sensitivity to input data modalities, and identify reasoning failures that predict final correctness. Together, these contributions provide transparent and reproducible empirical results and a failure taxonomy to guide future work on reasoning-driven system diagnosis."}

While countless meme coins are deployed across multiple blockchains, they rely heavily on off-chain web and social infrastructure to signal legitimacy. These very signals are largely absent from existing datasets, which are often limited to single-chain data or lack the multimodal artifacts required for comprehensive risk modeling.\n  To address this gap, we introduce MemeChain, a large-scale, open-source, cross-chain dataset comprising 34,988 meme coins across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. MemeChain integrates on-chain data with off-chain artifacts, including website HTML source code, token logos, and linked social media accounts, enabling multimodal and forensic study of meme coin projects. Analysis of the dataset shows that visual branding is frequently omitted in low-effort deployments, and many projects lack a functional website. Moreover, we quantify the ecosystem's extreme volatility, identifying 1,801 tokens (5.15%) that cease all trading activity within just 24 hours of launch. By providing unified cross-chain coverage and rich off-chain context, MemeChain serves as a foundational resource for research in financial forensics, multimodal anomaly detection, and automated scam prevention in the meme coin ecosystem."}

The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments."}

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments."}

However, their impact on clinicians' performance is ambiguous. Not knowing how clinicians use this new technology and how they compare it to traditional clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) restricts designing novel mechanisms that overcome existing tool limitations and enhance performance and experience. This qualitative study examines how clinicians (n=12) perceive different interaction modalities (text-based conversation with LLMs, interactive and static UI, and voice) for decision-support. In open-ended use of LLM-based tools, our participants took a tool-centric approach using them for information retrieval and confirmation with simple prompts instead of use as active deliberation partners that can handle complex questions. Critical engagement emerged with changes to the interaction setup. Engagement also differed with individual cognitive styles. Lastly, benefits and drawbacks of interaction with text, voice and traditional UIs for clinical decision-support show the lack of a one-size-fits-all interaction modality."}

The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items. Finally, the proposed RSC method was evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches."}

The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hardware experiments on a 1/10 car-like pusher demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Code and footage from our experiments can be found at: https://fluentrobotics.com/relopushboss."}

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures."}

The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties.

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic. We then present query algorithms that utilize COL-Trees to efficiently answer AkNN, kFN, and other queries. In our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform existing approaches, achieving up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement. Moreover, this comes at a small pre-processing overhead in both theory and practice."}

Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate."}

ScamPilot simulates scams with two large language model-powered agents: a scammer and a target. Users must help the target defend against the scammer by providing real-time advice. Through a between-subjects study (N=150) with one control and three experimental conditions, we find that blending advice-giving with multiple choice questions significantly increased scam recognition (+8%) without decreasing wariness towards legitimate conversations.

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models. Despite its additional validation steps, EFParser maintains high computational efficiency, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world log analysis deployment."}

We propose a general framework for IL under measurement error, inspired by explicitly modeling the causal relationships among the variables, yielding a target that retains a causal interpretation and is robust to distribution shift. Building on ideas from proximal causal inference, we introduce \\texttt{CausIL}, which treats noisy state observations as proxy variables, and we provide identification conditions under which the target policy is recoverable from demonstrations without rewards or interactive expert queries. We develop estimators for both discrete and continuous state spaces; for continuous settings, we use an adversarial procedure over RKHS function classes to learn the required parameters.

As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.\n  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers."}

In this letter, we show that common cellular KPIs can be efficiently compressed using standard lossy compression schemes based on prediction, quantization, and entropy coding, achieving substantial reductions in reporting overhead. Focusing on traffic volume KPIs, we first characterize their intrinsic compressibility through a rate-distortion analysis, showing that signal-to-noise ratios around 30 dB can be achieved using only 3-4 bits per sample, corresponding to an 8-10x reduction with respect to 32-bit floating-point representations. We then assess the impact of KPI compression on representative downstream analytics tasks. Our results show that aggregation across cells mitigates quantization errors and that prediction accuracy is unaffected beyond a moderate reporting rate. These findings indicate that KPI compression is feasible and transparent to network-level analytics in cellular systems."}

A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies. More broadly, we argue for applying tools developed to study human agent behavior to the analysis of non-human agents."}

While prior work has investigated students' cognitive offloading during episodic interactions, it remains unclear whether using genAI routinely is tied to more fundamental shifts in students' thinking habits.\n  Objective: We investigate (RQ1-How): how students' trust in and routine use of genAI affect their cognitive engagement -- specifically, reflection, need for understanding, and critical thinking in STEM coursework. Further, we investigate (RQ2-Who): which students are particularly vulnerable to these cognitive disengagement effects.\n  Method: We drew on dual-process theory, cognitive offloading, and automation bias literature to develop a statistical model explaining how and to what extent students' trust-driven routine use of genAI affected their cognitive engagement habits in coursework, and how these effects differed across students' cognitive styles. We empirically evaluated this model using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling on survey data from 299 STEM students across five North American universities.\n  Results: Students who trusted and routinely used genAI reported significantly lower cognitive engagement. Unexpectedly, students with higher technophilic motivations, risk tolerance, and computer self-efficacy -- traits often celebrated in STEM -- were more prone to these effects. Interestingly, prior experience with genAI or academia did not protect them from cognitively disengaging.\n  Implications: Our findings suggest a potential cognitive debt cycle in which routine genAI use progressively weakens students' intellectual habits, potentially driving over-reliance and escalating usage.

To address GNSS limitations and the impracticality of camera-based visual positioning, the work proposes a particle filter based fusion of GNSS and inertial data that incorporates spatial priors from maps, such as impassable buildings and unlikely walking areas, functioning as a probabilistic form of map matching. Inertial localization is provided by the RoNIN machine learning method, and fusion with GNSS is achieved by weighting particles based on their consistency with GNSS estimates and uncertainty. The system was evaluated on six challenging walking routes in downtown San Francisco using three metrics related to sidewalk correctness and localization error. Results show that the fused approach (GNSS+RoNIN+PF) significantly outperforms GNSS only localization on most metrics, while inertial-only localization with particle filtering also surpasses GNSS alone for critical measures such as sidewalk assignment and across street error."}

A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines."}

To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance.

We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores."}

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions. In the final stage, we introduce Latent-Space Neural Fictitious Self-Play (LS-NFSP), where competing agents learn competitive tactics by interacting within the latent action space rather than the raw motor space, significantly stabilizing multi-agent training. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboStriker achieves superior competitive performance in simulation and exhibits sim-to-real transfer. Our website is available at RoboStriker."}

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.\n  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that VarParser achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly improving parsing efficiency while reducing the LLM invocation costs."}

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities."}

Consequently, the visualizations remain confined to a single classroom, rather than being shared and adapted across courses or reused by other instructors. To address this gap and foster active engagement in live classrooms, we present a lightweight and seamless software framework named LEAP for developing interactive computational lab exercises using a simple idea: remotely callable instructor-defined functions. Using API endpoints and a provided client, students can discover and then call instructor defined functions remotely from their coding environment using scripts or interactive notebooks. Each function call is time-stamped and persistently logged in a database, allowing real-time visualization of participation, diverse solution paths, common pitfalls, and live feedback through collaboration, gamification, and quizzes. Labs are packaged as self-contained folders, each containing their own remotely callable functions.

Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios.

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration."}

We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics."}

Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities. Our work highlights the gap between functional and secure code generation in current LLMs."}

We present a mixed-methods study of explanation design strategies in AI-driven security dashboards. Through a taxonomy of explanation styles and a controlled user study with security practitioners, we compare natural language rationales, confidence visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and hybrid approaches. Our findings show that explanation style significantly affects user trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. We contribute (1) empirical evidence on the usability of explanation interfaces for security copilots, (2) design guidelines for integrating explainability into enterprise UIs, and (3) a framework for aligning explanation strategies with analyst needs in security operations centers (SOCs).

Yet, traditional safety-case practices from aviation or nuclear engineering rely on well-specified system boundaries, stable architectures, and known failure modes. Modern AI systems such as generative and agentic AI are the opposite. Their capabilities emerge unpredictably from low-level training objectives, their behaviour varies with prompts, and their risk profiles shift through fine-tuning, scaffolding, or deployment context. This study examines how safety cases are currently constructed for AI systems and why classical approaches fail to capture these dynamics. It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. The result is a systematic, composable, and reusable approach to constructing and maintaining safety cases that are credible, auditable, and adaptive to the evolving behaviour of generative and frontier AI systems."}

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings."}

Whilst there is broad consensus that robots can assist in mitigating physical impairments, the extent to which they can facilitate social inclusion remains equivocal. In fact, the exposed status of assisted workers could likewise lead to reduced or increased perceived stigma by other workers. We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot. In addition, offering robot-assisted work for everyone, in the sense of universal design, further reduces perceived cognitive stigma. Thus, we conclude that assistive robots reduce perceived cognitive stigma, thereby supporting the use of collaborative robots in work scenarios involving PwDs."}

However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy."}

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL."}

LLM-based search discovers exploits dynamically without pre-existing vulnerability graphs, while white-box access enables validating exploits in isolation before committing to attack paths. Evaluation at CIDeX 2025, a large-scale exercise spanning 46 IT hosts, showed that AEGIS-generated paths are comparable to human-authored scenarios across four dimensions of training experience (perceived learning, engagement, believability, challenge). Results were measured with a validated questionnaire extensible to general simulation-based training. By automating exploit chain discovery and validation, AEGIS reduces scenario development from months to days, shifting expert effort from technical validation to scenario design."}

Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests.

To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data.

We introduce FACET, a teacher-facing multi-agent framework designed to address these gaps by supporting differentiation that accounts for motivation, performance, and learning differences. Developed with educational stakeholders from the outset, the framework coordinates four specialized agents, including learner simulation, diagnostic assessment, material generation, and evaluation within a teacher-in-the-loop design.

This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates.

Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator\" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers."}

However, traditional coverage-guided fuzzing may be less effective in specific tasks like verifying static analysis reports or reproducing crashes, while directed fuzzing, focusing on targeted program locations using proximity metrics, proves to be more effective. Some of the earliest directed fuzzers are, for example, AFLGo and BEACON, which use different proximity metric approaches. Although most automated testing tools focus on C/C++ code, the growing popularity of Rust and Go causes the need for precise and efficient testing solutions for these languages. This work expands the applicability of directed fuzzing beyond traditional analysis of C/C++ software. We present a novel approach to directed greybox fuzzing tailored specifically for Rust and Go applications. We introduce advanced preprocessing techniques, rustc compiler customizations, and elaborate graph construction and instrumentation methods to enable effective targeting of specific program locations. Our implemented fuzzing tools, based on LibAFL-DiFuzz backend, demonstrate competitive advantages compared to popular existing fuzzers like afl.rs, cargo-fuzz, and go-fuzz. According to TTE (Time to Exposure) experiments, Rust-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms other tools by the best TTE result. Some stability issues can be explained by different mutation approaches. Go-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms its opponent by the best and, in the majority of cases, by average result, having two cases with orders of magnitude difference. These results prove better efficiency and accuracy of our approach."}

We address this point using a dual-assessment framework measuring both self-reported characteristics and observer-rated persona expression. Across two experiments testing four persona conditions (default, high, moderate, and low ADHD presentations), seven LLMs, and three semantically equivalent persona prompts, we examine between-conversation stability (3,473 conversations) and within-conversation stability (1,370 conversations and 18 turns). Self-reports remain highly stable both between and within conversations. However, observer ratings reveal a tendency for persona expressions to decline during extended conversations. These findings suggest that persona-instructed LLMs produce stable, persona-aligned self-reports, an important prerequisite for behavioral research, while identifying this regression tendency as a boundary condition for multi-agent social simulation."}

To address these gaps, we introduce a new multimodal anomaly dataset built on two open-source microservice systems: SocialNetwork and TrainTicket. We design and inject four categories of anomalies (Ano): performance-level, service-level, database-level, and code-level, to emulate realistic anomaly modes. For each scenario, we collect five modalities (Mod): logs, metrics, distributed traces, API responses, and code coverage reports, offering a richer, end-to-end view of system state and inter-service interactions. We name our dataset, reflecting its unique properties, as AnoMod. This dataset enables (1) evaluation of cross-modal anomaly detection and fusion/ablation strategies, and (2) fine-grained RCA studies across service and code regions, supporting end-to-end troubleshooting pipelines that jointly consider detection and localization."}

We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific \"fingerprints\".

Hardware Trojans, especially on control signals, are more low cost and impactful than data signals because a single corrupted control signal can disrupt or bypass entire computation sequences, whereas data faults usually cause only localized errors.

However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive \"generate-then-filter\" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms. On Jetson Orin Nano, SIDP delivers a 2.5$\\times$ faster inference than the baseline NavDP, i.e., 110ms VS 273ms, enabling efficient real-time deployment."}

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks. Overall, our study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are a powerful but non-uniform solution for SAST FP filtering, and that their practical deployment requires careful consideration of agent design, backbone model choice, vulnerability category, and operational cost."}

We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity.

In this paper, we present techniques developed during a long-term UX measurement project at a major software company to efficiently process and interpret extensive volumes of user comments. To provide a high-level overview of the collected comments, we employ a supervised machine learning approach that assigns meaningful, pre-defined topic labels to each comment.

To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations.

We propose ZK-HybridFL, a secure decentralized FL framework that integrates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger with dedicated sidechains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving model validation. The framework uses event-driven smart contracts and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments."}

To mitigate this threat, the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is critical. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of PQC algorithms on WPA-Enterprise-based authentication. To this end, we conduct an experimental evaluation of authentication latency using a testbed built with the open-source tools FreeRADIUS and hostapd, measuring the time spent at the client, access point, and RADIUS server. We evaluate multiple combinations of PQC algorithms and analyze their performance overhead in comparison to currently deployed cryptographic schemes. Beyond performance, we assess the security implications of these algorithm choices by relating authentication mechanisms to the quantum effort required for their exploitation. This perspective enables a systematic categorization of PQ-relevant weaknesses in WPA-Enterprise according to their practical urgency. The evaluation results show that, although PQC introduces additional authentication latency, combinations such as ML-DSA-65 and Falcon-1024 used in conjunction with ML-KEM provide a favorable trade-off between security and performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the resulting overhead can be effectively mitigated through session resumption. Overall, this work presents a first real-world performance evaluation of PQC-enabled WPA-Enterprise authentication and demonstrates its practical feasibility for enterprise Wi-Fi deployments."}

However, policymakers and local business owners have raised concerns about reduced storefront visibility and altered pedestrian navigation. Although sidewalk sheds are widely used for safety, their effects on pedestrian visibility and movement are not directly measured in current planning practices. To address this, we developed an AI-based chatbot survey that collects image-based annotations and route choices from pedestrians, linking these responses to specific shed design features, including clearance height, post spacing, and color. This AI chatbot survey integrates a large language model (e.g., Google's Gemini-1.5-flash-001 model) with an image-annotation interface, allowing users to interact with street images, mark visual elements, and provide structured feedback through guided dialogue. To explore pedestrian perceptions and behaviors, this paper conducts a grid-based analysis of entrance annotations and applies logistic mixed-effects modeling to assess sidewalk choice patterns. Analysis of the dataset (n = 25) shows that: (1) the presence of scaffolding significantly reduces pedestrians' ability to identify ground-floor retail entrances, and (2) variations in weather conditions and shed design features significantly influence sidewalk selection behavior. By integrating generative AI into urban research, this study demonstrates a novel method for evaluating sidewalk shed designs and provides empirical evidence to support adjustments to shed guidelines that improve the pedestrian experience without compromising safety."}

The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%.

Our findings reveal that patient agency is not a static individual attribute but a relational capacity shaped through maintaining everyday continuity, mutual recognition from care providers, and engagement with material home environments. Furthermore, we identified that structured documentation systems filter out contextual knowledge, informal communication channels fragment patient voices, and doctor-centered hierarchies position patients as passive recipients. Drawing on these insights, we propose design considerations to bridge this representation gap and to integrate patient agency into shared HBC plans."}

Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone."}

We fine-tune a \\texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features."}

We propose a KLM-style additive model, based on existing atomic task models in the literature, to predict task completion time for 3D interaction tasks. We performed two studies to evaluate the feasibility of this approach across multiple input modalities, with one study using a simple menu selection task and the other a more complex manipulation task. We found that several of the models from the literature predicted actual task performance with less than 20% error in both the menu selection and manipulation study. Overall, we found that additive models can predict both absolute and relative performance of input modalities with reasonable accuracy."}

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately."}

Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces."}

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available."}

Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects. In addition, the Interaction Flow Graph can reveal potential interaction design smells that may compromise intended functionality and hinder testing performance for VR applications."}

Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone. Supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/SCALAR."}

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control.

Although numerous automated microservice decomposition frameworks have been proposed, their evaluation is often fragmented due to inconsistent benchmark systems, incompatible metrics, and limited reproducibility, thus hindering objective comparison. This work presents a unified comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art microservice decomposition approaches spanning static, dynamic, and hybrid techniques. Using a consistent metric computation pipeline, we assess the decomposition quality across widely used benchmark systems (JPetStore, AcmeAir, DayTrader, and Plants) using Structural Modularity (SM), Interface Number(IFN), Inter-partition Communication (ICP), Non-Extreme Distribution (NED), and related indicators. Our analysis combines results reported in prior studies with experimentally reproduced outputs from available replication packages. Findings indicate that the hierarchical clustering-based methods, particularly HDBScan, produce the most consistently balanced decompositions across benchmarks, achieving strong modularity while minimizing communication and interface overhead."}

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation."}

We formalize SpecIBT as a transformation in Rocq and provide a machine-checked proof that it achieves relative security: any transformed program running with speculation leaks no more than what the source program leaks without speculation. This strong security guarantee applies to arbitrary programs, even those not following the cryptographic constant-time programming discipline."}

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale."}

Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status. Our findings show that project mission is associated with measurably different environments for newcomer-to-core transitions and provide evidence-based guidance for newcomers and maintainers."}

We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback."}

Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers."}

Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval."}

The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization.

We present a vignette study on the perceived cognitive and behavioral stigma toward PwD in the workplace. We designed four experimental conditions depicting a coworker with an impairment in work scenarios: overburdened work, suitable work, and robot-assisted work only for the coworker, and an offer of robot-assisted work for everyone. Our results show that cognitive stigma is significantly reduced when the work task is adapted to the person's abilities or augmented by an assistive robot.

This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision.

We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality."}

To help address these limitations, we propose WiFiPenTester, an experimental, governed, and reproducible system for GenAI-enabled wireless ethical hacking. The system integrates large language models into the reconnaissance and decision-support phases of wireless security assessment, enabling intelligent target ranking, attack feasibility estimation, and strategy recommendation, while preserving strict human-in-the-loop control and budget-aware execution. We describe the system architecture, threat model, governance mechanisms, and prompt-engineering methodology, and empirical experiments conducted across multiple wireless environments. The results demonstrate that GenAI assistance improves target selection accuracy and overall assessment efficiency, while maintaining auditability and ethical safeguards. This indicates that WiFiPenTester is a meaningful step toward practical, safe, and scalable GenAI-assisted wireless penetration testing, while reinforcing the necessity of bounded autonomy, human oversight, and rigorous governance mechanisms when deploying GenAI in ethical hacking."}

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control.

To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini.

To address this gap, we propose a novel Secure Tool Manifest and Digital Signing Framework, a structured and security-aware extension of Model Context Protocols. The framework enforces cryptographically signed manifests, integrates transparent verification logs, and isolates model-internal execution metadata from user-visible components to ensure verifiable execution integrity.

We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss.

In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates.

Deployed language models almost never follow it, instead being exposed through a single API endpoint that serves all users and requests. This gap exists not because least privilege would be unhelpful; deployments would benefit greatly from reducing unnecessary capability exposure. The real obstacle is definitional and mechanistic: what does \"access\" mean inside a language model, and how can we enforce it without retraining or deploying multiple models? We take inspiration from least privilege in computer systems and define a class of models called least-privilege language models, where privilege is reachable internal computation during the forward pass. In this view, lowering privilege literally shrinks the model's accessible function class, as opposed to denying access via learned policies. We formalize deployment-time control as a monitor-allocator-enforcer stack, separating (i) request-time signals, (ii) a decision rule that allocates privilege, and (iii) an inference-time mechanism that selects privilege. We then propose Nested Least-Privilege Networks, a shape-preserving, rank-indexed intervention that provides a smooth, reversible control knob. We show that this knob yields policy-usable privilege-utility frontiers and enables selective suppression of targeted capabilities with limited collateral degradation across various policies. Most importantly, we argue for a new deployment paradigm that challenges the premise that language models can only be controlled at the output level."}

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities."}

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most."}

To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities.

We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores."}

Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring."}

Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried."}

We introduce MAAT (Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories), a framework for symbolic discovery built on knowledge-informed Kernel State Reconstruction. MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines."}

However, the effectiveness of these systems depends not only on the accuracy of underlying models but also on the degree to which users can understand and trust their outputs. Existing research on algorithmic explainability has largely focused on model internals, while little attention has been given to how explanations should be surfaced in user interfaces for high-stakes decision-making contexts [8], [5], [6]. We present a mixed-methods study of explanation design strategies in AI-driven security dashboards. Through a taxonomy of explanation styles and a controlled user study with security practitioners, we compare natural language rationales, confidence visualizations, counterfactual explanations, and hybrid approaches. Our findings show that explanation style significantly affects user trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. We contribute (1) empirical evidence on the usability of explanation interfaces for security copilots, (2) design guidelines for integrating explainability into enterprise UIs, and (3) a framework for aligning explanation strategies with analyst needs in security operations centers (SOCs). This work advances the design of human-centered AI tools in cybersecurity and provides broader implications for explainability in other high-stakes domains."}

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality."}

Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone."}

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD."}

At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions. In addition, we also present a case study illustrating the limitation of the knowledge gradient in certain scenarios."}

However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks. To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs."}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations."}

We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training."}

We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents."}

We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores."}

We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction.

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples.

We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times.

We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process.

Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery."}

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods."}

While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning.

We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably."}

In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later.

Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe performance gains peaking at $8.8\\%$ and $5.8\\%$, respectively, on 8B-parameter models, confirming the scalability and effectiveness of our framework in large-scale masked diffusion language model regimes."}

These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability."}

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs."}

In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%."}

We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies.

Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio. We demonstrate that a single ES-SSM model trained once can be truncated to provide competitive performance compared with modern Transformer and SSM baselines at similar parameter scales. Furthermore, by testing under various runtime budgets, we observe smooth and stable budget-performance curves over a wide range of truncation levels."}

In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness.

Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection."}

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD."}

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods."}

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models."}

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort."}

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability."}

This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments."}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines."}

MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure.

To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training."}

To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training.

This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models.

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining."}

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability."}

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task.

Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases.

Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy."}

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs."}

Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling.

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification."}

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $α$-entmax attention with $α= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms."}

On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate that EntQuant does not only achieve state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation sets and models, but also retains functional performance on more complex benchmarks with instruction-tuned models, all at modest inference overhead."}

We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training."}

Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions."}

We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features.

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients."}

However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token.

This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight."}

Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer.

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency."}

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of \"memory-dense\" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets."}

Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline."}

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor."}

The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types.

We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions.

To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage."}

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice."}

Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms."}

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies."}

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective."}

We formalize this via an $\\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning.

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks."}

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations."}

Our approach employs parallel embedding streams to isolate the contribution of each interchangeable token in the input, combined with an aggregated attention mechanism that enables structured information sharing across streams. Experimental results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our method and demonstrate substantial performance gains on open-vocabulary tasks that require generalization to novel symbols."}

DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate.

We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner.

We present TEON's improved convergence guarantee over layer-wise Muon, and further develop a practical instantiation of TEON based on the theoretical analysis with corresponding ablation. We evaluate our approach on two widely adopted architectures: GPT-style models, ranging from 130M to 774M parameters, and LLaMA-style models, ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. Experimental results show that TEON consistently improves training and validation perplexity across model scales and exhibits strong robustness under various approximate SVD schemes."}

We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models."}

These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems."}

In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale."}

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures."}

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments."}

As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.\n  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers."}

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them.

Deployed language models almost never follow it, instead being exposed through a single API endpoint that serves all users and requests. This gap exists not because least privilege would be unhelpful; deployments would benefit greatly from reducing unnecessary capability exposure. The real obstacle is definitional and mechanistic: what does \"access\" mean inside a language model, and how can we enforce it without retraining or deploying multiple models? We take inspiration from least privilege in computer systems and define a class of models called least-privilege language models, where privilege is reachable internal computation during the forward pass. In this view, lowering privilege literally shrinks the model's accessible function class, as opposed to denying access via learned policies. We formalize deployment-time control as a monitor-allocator-enforcer stack, separating (i) request-time signals, (ii) a decision rule that allocates privilege, and (iii) an inference-time mechanism that selects privilege. We then propose Nested Least-Privilege Networks, a shape-preserving, rank-indexed intervention that provides a smooth, reversible control knob. We show that this knob yields policy-usable privilege-utility frontiers and enables selective suppression of targeted capabilities with limited collateral degradation across various policies. Most importantly, we argue for a new deployment paradigm that challenges the premise that language models can only be controlled at the output level."}

We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints.
