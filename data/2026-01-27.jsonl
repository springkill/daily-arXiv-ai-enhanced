Due to its significant advantages, e.g., non-contact, radar-based respiratory monitoring has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. Unfortunately, though it can achieve high monitoring accuracy, consumer electronics-grade radar data inevitably contains User-sensitive Identity Information (USI), which may be maliciously used and further lead to privacy leakage. To track these challenges, by variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adversarial loss-based encryption, we propose a novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm, Tru-RM, to perform automated respiratory monitoring through radio signals while effectively anonymizing USI. The key enablers of Tru-RM are Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD), Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE), and robust Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) used for attribute decomposition, identity encryption, and perturbed respiratory monitoring, respectively. Specifically, AFD is designed to decompose the raw radar signals into the universal respiratory component, the personal difference component, and other unrelated components. Then, by using large noise to drown out the other unrelated components, and the phase noise algorithm with a learning intensity parameter to eliminate USI in the personal difference component, FPE is designed to achieve complete user identity information encryption without affecting respiratory features. Finally, by designing the transferred generalized domain-independent network, PTN is employed to accurately detect respiration when waveforms change significantly. Extensive experiments based on various detection distances, respiratory patterns, and durations demonstrate the superior performance of Tru-RM on strong anonymity of USI, and high detection accuracy of perturbed respiratory waveforms."}

However, these platforms frequently fail to ensure adequate privacy protection, as evidenced by real-world breaches that exposed personally identifiable information (PII) and crypto addresses. Such leaks enable adversaries to link real-world identities to cryptocurrency transactions, undermining the presumed anonymity of cryptocurrency use.\n  We propose FC-GUARD, a privacy-preserving exchange system designed to preserve user anonymity without compromising regulatory compliance in the exchange of fiat currency for cryptocurrencies. Leveraging verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proof techniques, FC-GUARD enables fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges without revealing users' PII or fiat account details. This breaks the linkage between users' real-world identities and their cryptocurrency addresses, thereby upholding anonymity, a fundamental expectation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In addition, FC-GUARD complies with key regulations over cryptocurrency usage, such as know-your-customer requirements and auditability for tax reporting obligations by integrating a lawful de-anonymization mechanism that allows the auditing authority to identify misbehaving users. This ensures regulatory compliance while defaulting to privacy protection. We implement our system on both desktop and mobile platforms, and our evaluation shows its feasibility for practical deployment."}

To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks."}

This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%).

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods."}

These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems."}

We present an interview study with 16 victims of online dating romance scams in Iran who were minors when scammed. Findings show that, with westernized dating apps banned in Iran, scammers find teenage victims through messaging platforms tethered to local neighborhoods, offering relief for parental pressures around finding a marital partner and academic performance. Using threats, lies, and exploitation of emotional attachment lacking from their families, scammers pressured minors into financial and sexual favors.

Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter.

The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established."}

Additionally, to support useful application features, such systems increasingly have a large rich operating system (OS) at the cost of potential security bugs. Thus, if a malicious party gains supervisor privileges, they could cause real-world damage by denying service to time-sensitive programs. Many past approaches to this problem completely isolate time-sensitive programs with a hypervisor; however, this prevents the programs from accessing useful OS services\n  We introduce Ringmaster, a novel framework that enables enclaves or TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to asynchronously access rich, but potentially untrusted, OS services via Linux's io_uring. When service is denied by the untrusted OS, enclaves continue to operate on Ringmaster's minimal ARM TrustZone kernel with access to small, critical device drivers. This approach balances the need for secure, time-sensitive processing with the convenience of rich OS services. Additionally, Ringmaster supports large unmodified programs as enclaves, offering lower overhead compared to existing systems. We demonstrate how Ringmaster helps us build a working highly-secure system with minimal engineering. In our experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle, Ringmaster achieved nearly 1GiB/sec of data into enclave on a Raspberry Pi4b, 0-3% throughput overhead compared to non-enclave tasks."}

Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors."}

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development."}

These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.\n  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage. Additionally, we can use these mechanisms to help produce program fixes for incorrect programs, with a guarantee that the fixes are correct. All three applications, leveraging on the mechanisms of Eiffel and Design by Contract, hold significant promise to address some of the challenges of program testing, software maintenance and Automatic Program Repair."}

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art."}

These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems."}

To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment.

This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail. Furthermore, we quantify the fundamental trade-offs between digital model fidelity, computational latency, and trajectory prediction horizons, proving that high-fidelity and predictive digital twins are feasible in real-world urban environments."}

We found that different pedagogical roles shaped learning dynamics, including interaction patterns and experiences.

While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research.

This study proposes a four-stage transaction management framework for document-oriented NoSQL databases, with MongoDB as the reference platform. The framework combines transaction lifecycle management, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, and an adaptive locking strategy with timeout-based deadlock prevention. Formal correctness analysis shows that the proposed approach guarantees conflict serializability under defined conditions. An experimental evaluation using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) workloads A, B, and F, with concurrency levels ranging from 1 to 100 clients, demonstrates a reduction in transaction abort rates from 8.3% to 4.7%, the elimination of observed deadlocks, and a 34.2% decrease in latency variance. Throughput improvements ranging from 6.3% to 18.4% are observed under high concurrency, particularly for read-modify-write workloads. Distributed experiments on clusters of up to 9 nodes confirm scalability, achieving 15.2% higher throughput and 53% lower abort rates than baseline systems. Comparisons with MongoDB's native transactions, CockroachDB, and TiDB indicate that the proposed framework strikes a good balance between consistency guarantees and performance overhead. Sensitivity analysis identifies optimal parameter settings, including a lock timeout of 100 ms, an initial backoff of 10 ms, and a maximum backoff of 500 ms. These results show that carefully designed consistency mechanisms can significantly improve data integrity in NoSQL systems without undermining scalability."}

However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security. The simulation results on open-source datasets verify that, AgentSemSteCom achieves better transmission quality and higher security levels than the baseline scheme."}

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings."}

Meaningful progress requires a holistic system-level view. We sketch such a framework drawing on ideas from complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change.

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods."}

However, this defense paradigm assumes such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal. We challenge this assumption with DeMark, a query-free black-box attack framework that targets defensive image watermarking schemes for deepfakes. DeMark exploits latent-space vulnerabilities in encoder-decoder watermarking models through a compressive sensing based sparsification process, suppressing watermark signals while preserving perceptual and structural realism appropriate for deepfakes. Across eight state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to 32.9% on average while maintaining natural visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. We further evaluate three defense strategies, including image super resolution, sparse watermarking, and adversarial training, and find them largely ineffective. These results demonstrate that current encoder decoder watermarking schemes remain vulnerable to latent-space manipulations, underscoring the need for more robust watermarking methods to safeguard against deepfakes."}

Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work."}

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency.

While prior research has examined device-access practices, explicit privacy-rule negotiation, and toxic practices such as surveillance, little is known about how couples manage digital privacy without direct discussion in everyday relationships. To address this gap, we ask: How is digital privacy managed nonverbally and across different media on mobile phones? Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, we find that partners often regulate privacy practices through privacy silence -- the intentional avoidance of privacy-related conversations. We identify five motivations for leaving boundaries unspoken: perceiving privacy as unnecessary in intimacy, assuming implicit respect for boundaries, signaling trust and closeness, avoiding potential conflict or harm, and responding to broader societal and cultural expectations that discourage explicit privacy talk. We also identify a hierarchical grouping of content-specific privacy sensitivities, ranging from highly private domains such as financial data to lower-risk domains such as streaming accounts, and show how these priorities shift across relationship stages. These findings show how silence, culture, and content sensitivity shape everyday boundary-setting and underscore the relational and emotional dynamics underpinning mobile phone privacy management."}

To address this challenge, we conducted a design exploration study where we created and iterated on 33 designs, each focusing on a subset of needs, for example, only one musical skill. Our designs are grounded in our own experience as musicians and the ideas and feedback of 18 musicians with various musical backgrounds and we evaluated them with 13 music learners and teachers. This paper presents the results of our exploration, focusing on a few example designs as instances of possible instrument practice visualizations. From our work, we draw design considerations that contribute to future research and products for visual instrument education."}

The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients.

We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines.

Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis.

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles."}

However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations."}

In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case.

Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces."}

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments."}

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications."}

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment.

Finally, having every individual sufficiently informed about data collection practices to ensure truly informed consent has proven impractical.\n  We propose collective consent, operationalized through consent assemblies, as one alternative framework. We establish the theoretical foundations of collective consent and employ speculative design to envision how consent assemblies could function by leveraging deliberative mini-publics. We present two vignettes: i) replacing notice and consent, and ii) collecting consent for GenAI model training, to demonstrate its wide application. Our paper employs future backcasting to identify the requirements for realizing collective consent and explores its potential applications in contexts where individual consent is infeasible."}

Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages."}

We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles. We further propose risk measures based on contagion paths and analyze how propagation dynamics influence optimal defense strategies. Numerical experiments explore risk versus cost efficient frontiers varying network topologies and risk profiles, revealing patterns of resource allocation and cyber deception effects.

Recently, UMH has been shown to present not only conventional vibrotactile sensations but also static pressure sensations by locally rotating an ultrasound focus at several hertz. With these pressure and vibration sensations, UMH covers three mechanoreceptors on which tactile perception relies: SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II. This study proposes a texture rendering method in UMH based on these receptor characteristics. Three basic ultrasonic stimuli corresponding to each mechanoreceptor are designed, and tactile textures are rendered through their combinations. For SA-I, a pressure stimuli were employed. For FA-I and FA-II, vibration stimuli at 30 Hz and 150 Hz, respectively, are employed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can render at least six discriminable textures with different roughness and friction sensations. Notably, through comparisons with real physical objects, we found that the pressure-only stimulus was perceived as slippery and smooth. Its smoothness was similar to a glass-marble. When vibration stimuli were synthesized, the perceived roughness and friction increased significantly. The roughness level reached that of a 100-grit sandpaper."}

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering."}

From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools.

They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web."}

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier.

For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras.

Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies.

Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces."}

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations."}

Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers."}

Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness."}

Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control."}

Using Mutual Theory of Mind as an analytical lens, we demonstrate that trust is shaped by epistemic evaluations while reliance is driven by social factors -- and these may operate independently."}

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses."}

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier.

A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution."}

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets."}

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains."}

Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties).

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning.

This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\\%$ improvement over cross-attention.

In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case.

To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization."}

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated."}

To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency.

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments."}

To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration.

We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs."}

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss.

Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.\n  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.\n  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation."}

Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble."}

Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods."}

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding."}

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios."}

The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training."}

It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface.

We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention.

This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%.

However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care."}

We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment. The result is a practical path from behavioral tracing and learning to enforceable, explainable, and risk-proportionate encryption control on production Linux systems."}
