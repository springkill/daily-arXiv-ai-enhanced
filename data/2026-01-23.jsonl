However, little is known about the characteristics of these GenAI-based chatbots and their user interactions. Drawing on the functional theory of NSFW on social media, this study analyzes 376 NSFW chatbots and 307 public conversation sessions on FlowGPT. Findings identify four chatbot types: roleplay characters, story generators, image generators, and do-anything-now bots. AI Characters portraying fantasy personas and enabling hangout-style interactions are most common, often using explicit avatar images to invite engagement. Sexual, violent, and insulting content appears in both user prompts and chatbot outputs, with some chatbots generating explicit material even when users do not create erotic prompts. In sum, the NSFW experience on FlowGPT can be understood as a combination of virtual intimacy, sexual delusion, violent thought expression, and unsafe content acquisition. We conclude with implications for chatbot design, creator support, user safety, and content moderation."}

To examine the effect of these events on expressed language, we analyze daily sentiment, emotion, and LIWC counts using quasi-experimental methods: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Causal Impact analyses during a financial boom and a financial crash.

Prior work derived a definition of \"spiritual support\" through co-design workshops with stakeholders in online health communities.

Through re-analysis of previous data and new interviews with SCPs, we identify three prerequisites for meaningful spiritual care: openness to care, safe space, and the ability to discern and articulate spiritual needs. We also propose six design dimensions: loving presence, meaning-making, appropriate degree of technology use, location, degree of relational closeness, and temporality. We discuss how SPIRIT offers guidance for designing impactful digital spiritual care intervention systems within and beyond clinical settings."}

However, as visual complexity increases, perceptual performance declines, making it more difficult to detect changes quickly and accurately. This study examines how visual features, known for facilitating preattentive processing, impact a change detection task in immersive 3D environments, with a focus on visual complexity, object attributes, and spatial proximity. Our results demonstrate that preattentive processing enhances change detection, particularly when the altered object is spatially isolated and not perceptually grouped with similar surrounding objects. Changes to isolated objects were detected more reliably, suggesting that perceptual isolation reduces cognitive load and draws more attention. Conversely, when a changed object was surrounded by visually similar elements, participants were less likely to detect the change, indicating that perceptual grouping hinders individual object recognition in complex scenes. These results provide guidelines for designing VR applications that strategically utilize spatial isolation and visual features to improve the user experience."}

We introduce a new approach for reconstructing proofs found by SMT solvers which we intend to be complementary with existing techniques. Rather than verifying or replaying a full proof produced by the SMT solver, or at the other extreme, rediscovering the solver's proof from just the set of premises it uses, we explore an approach which helps guide an interactive theorem prover's internal automation by leveraging derived facts during solving, which we call hints. This makes it possible to extract more information from the SMT solver's proof without the cost of retaining a dependency on the SMT solver itself. We implement a tactic in the Lean proof assistant, called QuerySMT, which leverages hints from the cvc5 SMT solver to improve existing Lean automation. We evaluate QuerySMT's performance on relevant Lean benchmarks, compare it to other tools available in Lean relating to SMT solving, and show that the hints generated by cvc5 produce a clear improvement in existing automation's performance."}

Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the problem, we are given with $\\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \\ldots, k_{\\ell}$, the goal here is to search for $\\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{\\ell}$ such that for all $i \\in [\\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \\leq k_i$ and for all $i \\neq j$, $S_i \\cap S_j=\\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization. To solve the common-slot variant, we formulate the problem as a multi-submodular cover problem and design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm based on the continuous greedy framework and randomized rounding. For the disjoint-slot variant, we proposed a sampling-based approximation approach along with an efficient primal-dual greedy algorithm that enforces disjointness naturally. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approaches."}

However, the lack of standardized evaluation models in current literature makes an objective comparison of diverse optimization strategies difficult. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a unified benchmarking framework that standardizes cost catalogs and deployment scenarios. We formulate the network design problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to establish optimality bounds and evaluate three scalable heuristic strategies: a Genetic Algorithm, K-Means Clustering (KMC+), and a graph-based Randomized Successive Splitter Assignment (RSSA+) algorithm. Simulation results show that a time-limited ILP remains a strong reference point, even when optimality is not reached. Despite being rarely used in prior fronthaul planning studies, it consistently yields solutions superior to those produced by standard heuristic methods. Among scalable approaches, RSSA+ reliably attains near-ILP performance while ensuring feasibility across all evaluated scenarios, which underscores the importance of advanced, constraint-aware algorithmic designs over simpler heuristics. The complete benchmarking framework and datasets are publicly shared in [1]."}

However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain.

These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical.

Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative \"evolutionary paths\" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM.

However, optimizing SCs remains challenging, particularly in partner selection, a key bottleneck shaped by competitive and cooperative dynamics.

Traditional approaches, grounded in mathematical simplifications and managerial heuristics, fail to capture real-world intricacies and risk introducing subjective biases. Multi-agent simulation offers promise, but prior research has largely relied on fixed, uniform agent logic, limiting practical applicability. Recent advances in LLMs create opportunities to represent complex SC requirements and hybrid game logic. However, challenges persist in modeling dynamic SC relationships, ensuring interpretability, and balancing agent autonomy with expert control. We present SCSimulator, a visual analytics framework that integrates LLM-driven MAS with human-in-the-loop collaboration for SC partner selection. It simulates SC evolution via adaptive network structures and enterprise behaviors, which are visualized via interpretable interfaces. By combining CoT reasoning with XAI techniques, it generates multi-faceted, transparent explanations of decision trade-offs. Users can iteratively adjust simulation settings to explore outcomes aligned with their expectations and strategic priorities.

In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.\n  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses.

This design improves population diversity during search and reduces premature convergence while preserving the exploration behavior of GEO.\n  GEGO is evaluated on standard unimodal, multimodal, and composite benchmark functions from the CEC2017 suite, where it consistently outperforms its constituent algorithms and several classical metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and robustness. The algorithm is further applied to hyperparameter tuning of artificial neural networks on the MNIST dataset, where GEGO achieves improved classification accuracy and more stable convergence compared to GEO and GA. These results indicate that GEGO provides a balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff and is well suited for hyperparameter optimization under constrained computational settings."}

Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To realize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal-conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the signal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices."}

Under review", "summary": "Network defenders face a steady stream of attacks, observed as raw Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts. The sheer volume of alerts demands prioritization, typically based on high-level risk classifications. This work expands the scope of risk measurement by examining alerts not only through their technical characteristics but also by examining and classifying their temporal patterns. One critical issue in responding to intrusion alerts is determining whether an alert is part of an escalating attack pattern or an opportunistic scan. To identify the former, we apply extreme-regime forecasting methods from financial modeling to IDS data. Extreme-regime forecasting is designed to identify likely future high-impact events or significant shifts in system behavior. Using these methods, we examine attack patterns by computing per-minute alert intensity, volatility, and a short-term momentum measure derived from weighted moving averages.\n  We evaluate the efficacy of a supervised learning model for forecasting future escalation patterns using these derived features. The trained model identifies future high-intensity attacks and demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving approximately 91\\% accuracy, 89\\% recall, and 98\\% precision. Our contributions provide a temporal measurement framework for identifying future high-intensity attacks and demonstrate the presence of predictive early-warning signals within the temporal structure of IDS alert streams. We describe our methods in sufficient detail to enable reproduction using other IDS datasets. In addition, we make the trained models openly available to support further research. Finally, we introduce an interpretable visualization that enables defenders to generate early predictive warnings of elevated volumetric arrival risk."}

An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future."}

The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic \"kickback\" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions. Our findings promote the advancement of haptic feedback systems for robotic surgery, offering a realistic and reliable interface for robot-assisted surgical procedures."}

However, their operational efficiency and resource consumption remain poorly understood, hindering practical adoption due to unpredictable costs and environmental impact. To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols."}

In this paper, we propose POEM (Proximal Policy Optimization with Evolutionary Mutations), a novel modification to PPO that introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism inspired by evolutionary algorithms. POEM enhances policy diversity by monitoring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a moving average of previous policies. When policy changes become minimal, indicating stagnation, POEM triggers an adaptive mutation of policy parameters to promote exploration. We evaluate POEM on four OpenAI Gym environments: CarRacing, MountainCar, BipedalWalker, and LunarLander. Through extensive fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization techniques and statistical testing using Welch's t-test, we find that POEM significantly outperforms PPO on three of the four tasks (BipedalWalker: t=-2.0642, p=0.0495; CarRacing: t=-6.3987, p=0.0002; MountainCar: t=-6.2431, p<0.0001), while performance on LunarLander is not statistically significant (t=-1.8707, p=0.0778).

Two business models to be implemented by a network operator, who owns the network, and a virtual operator, who does not, are proposed.

In the other business model, named \\emph{monopolistic}, the network operator provides service to both user bases. The two proposals are analyzed by means of a model that captures both system and economic features. As regards the systems features, the slicing of the network is modeled by means of a Discriminatory Processor Sharing queue. As regards the economic features, the incentives are modeled by means of the user utilities and the operators' revenues; and game theory is used to model the strategic interaction between the users' subscription decision and the operators' pricing decision. In both business models, it is shown that the network operator can be provided with the appropriate economic incentives so that it acquiesces in serving the virtual operator's user base (monopolistic model) and in allowing the virtual operator to provide service over the network operator's infrastructure (strategic model). From the point of view of the users, the strategic model results in a higher subscription rate than the monopolistic model."}

These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \\emph{unique}, \\emph{redundant}, and \\emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments."}

Our main contribution is a sound and complete Hilbert-style finite axiomatization for the logic, which captures the equivalences of REwLA. Using the extended operators, the completeness is established via a reduction into an identity-free variant of PDL on finite strict linear orders. Moreover, the extended PDL has the same computational complexity as REwLA."}

Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested.

Based on a broader, more grounded understanding of the term, in we identify several issues in the design of OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP: insecure practices, static, and subject-bound credential types, and a limited query language restrict their application to classic scenarios of credential exchange -- already supported by existing solutions like OpenID Connect, SIOPv2, OIDC4IDA, and OIDC Claims Aggregation -- barring dynamic, asynchronous, or automated use cases. We also debunk OpenID's 'paradigm-shifting' trust-model, which -- when compared to existing decentralized alternatives -- does not deliver any significant increase in control, privacy, and portability of personal information. Not only the technical choices limit the capabilities of the EUDI framework; also the legislation itself cannot accommodate the promise of self-sovereign identity. In particular, we criticize the introduction of institutionalized trusted lists, and discuss their economical and political risks. Their potential to decline into an exclusory, re-centralized ecosystem endangers the vision of a user-oriented identity management in which individuals are in charge. Instead, the consequences might severely restrict people in what they can do with their personal information, and risk increased linkability and monitoring. In anticipation of revisions to the EUDI regulations, we suggest several technical alternatives that overcome some of the issues with the architecture of OpenID. In particular, OAuth's UMA extension and its A4DS profile, as well as their integration in GNAP, are worth looking into. Future research into uniform query (meta-)languages is needed to address the heterogeneity of attestations and providers."}

This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks."}

Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments."}

Miscommunications aren't noticed, systemic biases have no counter-action, and inner monologues are rarely written down.\n  We did not come to fire them for their mistakes, but to hire them and provide a safe productive working environment. We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.\n  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs. A survey from our traces shows that we only trade off cost and latency to achieve correctness and incrementally expand capabilities without impacting existing ones."}

Using fine-grained behavioral analysis and automated critical thinking assessment, we found that interface design fundamentally alters exploration strategies and evidence integration.

Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations. We then propose a multi-modal segmentation framework that leverages temporal models to detect semantically meaningful event boundaries in sequential manipulations. Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks."}

Usually, the correctness of such machines is made plausible by some informal explanations of their basic ideas, augmented with a few sample executions, but neither by rigorous mathematical nor mechanized formal proof. No wonder: The invariants (and variants) required for such proofs are big artifacts, peppered with overpowering technical details.

Modern cloud-native DDoS attacks further evolve rapidly and often blend multi-vector strategies, creating an operational dilemma: defenders need wire-speed monitoring while also requiring explainable, auditable attribution for response. Existing rule-based and supervised-learning approaches typically output black-box scores or labels, provide limited evidence chains, and generalize poorly to unseen attack variants; meanwhile, high-quality labeled data is often difficult to obtain in cloud settings.\n  We present Holmes (DDoS Detective), an LLM-based DDoS detection agent that reframes the model as a virtual SRE investigator rather than an end-to-end classifier. Holmes couples a funnel-like hierarchical workflow (counters/sFlow for continuous sensing and triage; PCAP evidence collection triggered only on anomaly windows) with an Evidence Pack abstraction that converts binary packets into compact, reproducible, high-signal structured evidence. On top of this evidence interface, Holmes enforces a structure-first investigation protocol and strict JSON/quotation constraints to produce machine-consumable reports with auditable evidence anchors.\n  We evaluate Holmes on CICDDoS2019 reflection/amplification attacks and script-triggered flooding scenarios. Results show that Holmes produces attribution decisions grounded in salient evidence anchors across diverse attack families, and when errors occur, its audit logs make the failure source easy to localize, demonstrating the practicality of an LLM agent for cost-controlled and traceable DDoS investigation in cloud operations."}

Feedback welcome on DHT incentive models and capability mapping service design", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery."}

Current co-design practices, including workshops and AI-assisted frameworks, struggle with low user engagement, inefficient preference collection, and difficulties in balancing user feedback with design considerations. To address these challenges, we conducted a formative study with designers and users experienced in co-design (N=7), identifying critical challenges for current collaboration between designers and users in the co-design process, and their requirements. Informed by these insights, we introduce DesignBridge, a multi-platform AI-enhanced interactive system that bridges designer expertise and user preferences through three stages: (1) Initial Design Framing, where designers define initial concepts. (2) Preference Expression Collection, where users intuitively articulate preferences via interactive tools. (3) Preference-Integrated Design, where designers use AI-assisted analytics to integrate feedback into cohesive designs. A user study demonstrates that DesignBridge significantly enhances user preference collection and analysis, enabling designers to integrate diverse preferences with professional expertise."}

To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric."}

We show that monotone truncation suffices to guarantee finite witnessability for individual queries. For classes of queries, we identify finite generation of witness certificates as the additional condition required to obtain a uniform retrieval bound, and we show that this condition is necessary. We further exhibit sharp counterexamples demonstrating failure under non-monotone truncation, non-finitely-generated query classes, and purely slotwise coverage.\n  Together, these results isolate feasibility preservation as a correctness criterion for retrieval independent of relevance scoring or optimization, and clarify structural limitations inherent to truncation-based retrieval."}

By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity.

This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement."}

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement. After each generation, ARISE tests script executability in simulation software, feeding structured diagnostics back to the LLM until both syntactic and functional requirements are met. This process significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Through extensive evaluation, ARISE outperforms the baseline in generating semantically accurate and executable traffic scenarios with greater reliability and robustness."}

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate."}

To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens.

However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead. Moreover, FastFI accurately identifies high-impact APIs and provides actionable guidance for call-site hardening."}

This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods."}

We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%. Our results suggest that dialogue structure constitutes an important and under-studied attack surface for multi-turn LLM systems, motivating structure-aware auditing and mitigation in practice."}

In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles. Our findings establish that modeling how agents act-not only who they are-is necessary for advancing GABM as a tool for studying social media phenomena."}

However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing."}

To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise.

In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts.

Online Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations. It contributes methodological transparency through open data and replication materials, and conceptual insight by relating observed communication patterns to principles of requirements communication. The findings offer evidence-based implications for how developers and RE practitioners can craft clearer and more effective explanations, potentially supporting fairer communication in both open and organizational contexts. From an RE perspective, these determinants can be interpreted as practical signals for ambiguity reduction and rationale articulation in day-to-day requirements communication."}

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\\%$ detection rate.

To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification.

This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment."}

We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale $200m\\times130m$ building environment."}

The method evaluates the necessity of range checks concerning performance implications and generates appropriate fixes. We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy. This result was 13.56% behind the optimal solutions created by human developers. These findings demonstrate that our LLM-based approach can reduce the manual effort to address compiler warnings while maintaining code quality and performance in a real-world scenario.

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency.

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making."}

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.\n  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict.\n  For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\\times$ and API costs by 10$\\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS.\n  The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work."}

Based on a broader, more grounded understanding of the term, in we identify several issues in the design of OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP: insecure practices, static, and subject-bound credential types, and a limited query language restrict their application to classic scenarios of credential exchange -- already supported by existing solutions like OpenID Connect, SIOPv2, OIDC4IDA, and OIDC Claims Aggregation -- barring dynamic, asynchronous, or automated use cases. We also debunk OpenID's 'paradigm-shifting' trust-model, which -- when compared to existing decentralized alternatives -- does not deliver any significant increase in control, privacy, and portability of personal information. Not only the technical choices limit the capabilities of the EUDI framework; also the legislation itself cannot accommodate the promise of self-sovereign identity. In particular, we criticize the introduction of institutionalized trusted lists, and discuss their economical and political risks. Their potential to decline into an exclusory, re-centralized ecosystem endangers the vision of a user-oriented identity management in which individuals are in charge. Instead, the consequences might severely restrict people in what they can do with their personal information, and risk increased linkability and monitoring. In anticipation of revisions to the EUDI regulations, we suggest several technical alternatives that overcome some of the issues with the architecture of OpenID.

We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy.

Traditional detection models often fail to generalize due to significant data drift and the inherent absence of labeled anomalies in new target domains. To handle the above challenges, we proposed a new end-to-end framework based on a meta-learning approach. Our methodology first gets the data ready by combining a Drain3 log parsing mechanism with a dynamic drift-based labeling technique that uses semantic and fuzzy matching to move existing anomaly knowledge from one source to another. BERT-based semantic embeddings are obtained, and the feature selection is invoked to reduce the dimensionality. Later, Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks models are trained to adapt quickly and effectively. The SMOTE oversampling method is employed to handle imbalances in the data. All the results are obtained by employing the leave-one-out source method, and the corresponding mean F1 scores are reported.

Due to this prevailing belief, the possibility of (maliciously) perturbed benign packets being misclassified as attack has been largely ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly."}

However, this remains challenging for cable-driven robots, such as the da Vinci robot, because erroneous encoder readings lead to pose estimation errors. In this study, we propose a calibration framework to produce accurate tool localization results through computing the hand-eye transformation matrix on-the-fly. The framework consists of two interrelated algorithms: the feature association block and the hand-eye calibration block, which provide robust correspondences for key points detected on monocular images without pre-training, and offer the versatility to accommodate various surgical scenarios by adopting an array of filter approaches, respectively. To validate its efficacy, we test the framework extensively on publicly available video datasets that feature multiple surgical instruments conducting tasks in both in vitro and ex vivo scenarios, under varying illumination conditions and with different levels of key point measurement accuracy. The results show a significant reduction in tool localization errors under the proposed calibration framework, with accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being more time-efficient."}

However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization. We evaluate functional correctness through execution-based and similarity-based metrics, complemented by comprehensive code quality analysis--an aspect largely overlooked in prior work. Our findings show that Multi-task QLoRA effectively leverages transfer learning, achieving competitive or superior performance relative to both Single-task QLoRA and Multi-task full fine-tuning. Larger models demonstrate more consistent balance between correctness and quality, whereas smaller models preserve functionality but exhibit a higher incidence of quality-related issues."}

However, most existing deep learning approaches treat chemical and transcriptomic modalities independently or combine them only at late stages, limiting their ability to model fine-grained, context-dependent mechanisms of drug action. In addition, standard attention mechanisms are often sensitive to noise and sparsity in high-dimensional biological networks, hindering both generalization and interpretability. We present DiSPA, a representation learning framework that explicitly disentangles structure-driven and context-driven mechanisms of drug response through bidirectional conditioning between chemical substructures and pathway-level gene expression. DiSPA introduces a differential cross-attention module that suppresses spurious pathway-substructure associations while amplifying contextually relevant interactions. Across multiple evaluation settings on the GDSC benchmark, DiSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong improvements in the disjoint-set setting, which assesses generalization to unseen drug-cell combinations. Beyond predictive accuracy, DiSPA yields mechanistically informative representations: learned attention patterns recover known pharmacophores, distinguish structure-driven from context-dependent compounds, and exhibit coherent organization across biological pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiSPA trained solely on bulk RNA-seq data enables zero-shot transfer to spatial transcriptomics, revealing region-specific drug sensitivity patterns without retraining. Together, these results establish DiSPA as a robust and interpretable framework for integrative pharmacogenomic modeling, enabling principled analysis of drug response mechanisms beyond post hoc interpretation."}

The system reduced erroneous selections by up to 95% for dwell time and gaze and head, and was positively received by most users. Performance varied for nodding and between individuals, suggesting the need for adaptive systems.

We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms.

We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments."}

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size. Under non-paused inference protocols, TIDAL remains robust where standard baselines fail due to latency."}

Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings."}

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub", "comment": "Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)", "summary": "AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows."}

We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps."}

An access control mechanism is as effective as the policy it enforces. However, authoring effective policies that satisfy desired properties such as the principle of least privilege is a challenging task even for experienced administrators, as evidenced by many real instances of policy misconfiguration. In this paper, we set out to address this pain point by proposing Restricter, which automatically tightens each (permit) policy rule of a policy with respect to an access log, which captures some already exercised access requests and their corresponding access decisions (i.e., allow or deny). Restricter achieves policy tightening by reducing the number of access requests permitted by a policy rule without sacrificing the functionality of the underlying system it is regulating. We implement Restricter for Amazon's Cedar policy language and demonstrate its effectiveness through two realistic case studies."}

However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research."}

A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel.

To understand the bugs encountered during agent development, we present the first comprehensive study of bug types, root causes, and effects in LLM agent-based software.

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data."}

However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase."}

However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$ω$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $ω= κv$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods. The proposed method has been integrated into the official Nav2 repository and is publicly available (https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2)."}

We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation."}

Modern cloud-native DDoS attacks further evolve rapidly and often blend multi-vector strategies, creating an operational dilemma: defenders need wire-speed monitoring while also requiring explainable, auditable attribution for response. Existing rule-based and supervised-learning approaches typically output black-box scores or labels, provide limited evidence chains, and generalize poorly to unseen attack variants; meanwhile, high-quality labeled data is often difficult to obtain in cloud settings.\n  We present Holmes (DDoS Detective), an LLM-based DDoS detection agent that reframes the model as a virtual SRE investigator rather than an end-to-end classifier. Holmes couples a funnel-like hierarchical workflow (counters/sFlow for continuous sensing and triage; PCAP evidence collection triggered only on anomaly windows) with an Evidence Pack abstraction that converts binary packets into compact, reproducible, high-signal structured evidence. On top of this evidence interface, Holmes enforces a structure-first investigation protocol and strict JSON/quotation constraints to produce machine-consumable reports with auditable evidence anchors.\n  We evaluate Holmes on CICDDoS2019 reflection/amplification attacks and script-triggered flooding scenarios. Results show that Holmes produces attribution decisions grounded in salient evidence anchors across diverse attack families, and when errors occur, its audit logs make the failure source easy to localize, demonstrating the practicality of an LLM agent for cost-controlled and traceable DDoS investigation in cloud operations."}

As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications. The programming code for an exemplary implementation of Gaussian uncertainties is also provided."}

We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers."}

Whaling is a form of social engineering that targets important high-authority individuals within organizations and uses sophisticated fraudulent emails. In the context of Japanese universities, faculty members frequently hold positions that combine research leadership with authority within institutional workflows. This structural characteristic leads to the wide public disclosure of high-value information such as publications, grants, and detailed researcher profiles. Such extensive information exposure enables the construction of highly precise target profiles using generative AI. This raises concerns that Whaling attacks based on high-precision profiling by generative AI will become prevalent. In this study, we propose a Whaling countermeasure framework for university faculty members that constructs personalized defense profiles and uses large language model (LLM)-based agents. We design agents that (i) build vulnerability profiles for each target from publicly available information on faculty members, (ii) identify potential risk scenarios relevant to Whaling defense based on those profiles, (iii) construct defense profiles corresponding to the vulnerabilities and anticipated risks, and (iv) analyze Whaling emails using the defense profiles. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary risk-assessment experiment. The results indicate that the proposed method can produce judgments accompanied by explanations of response policies that are consistent with the work context of faculty members who are Whaling targets. The findings also highlight practical challenges and considerations for future operational deployment and systematic evaluation."}

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable."}

Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization. To enhance the prediction of this high-dimensional representation, we introduce an occupancy-diffusion model with voxel-level conditional guidance and force closure score filtering. In the second stage, we develop several energy functions and ranking strategies for optimization based on sparse IBS to generate high-quality dexterous grasp poses. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its capability to mitigate collisions while maintaining a high grasp success rate across diverse objects and complex scenes."}

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts."}

Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses."}

Tagliaferri", "Inseung Kang"], "title": "Systematic Evaluation of Hip Exoskeleton Assistance Parameters for Enhancing Gait Stability During Ground Slip Perturbations", "comment": null, "summary": "Falls are the leading cause of injury related hospitalization and mortality among older adults. Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization. This study represents an important step toward personalized, stability-focused exoskeleton control, with direct implications for improving stability and reducing fall risk in older adults."}

However, due to the characteristic of sequential generation of ARMs, the stegotext generated by ARM-based PSLS methods will produce serious error propagation once it changes, making existing methods unavailable under an active tampering attack. To address this, we propose a robust, provably secure linguistic steganography with diffusion language models (DLMs). Unlike ARMs, DLMs can generate text in a partially parallel manner, allowing us to find robust positions for steganographic embedding that can be combined with error-correcting codes. Furthermore, we introduce error correction strategies, including pseudo-random error correction and neighborhood search correction, during steganographic extraction. Theoretical proof and experimental results demonstrate that our method is secure and robust. It can resist token ambiguity in stegotext segmentation and, to some extent, withstand token-level attacks of insertion, deletion, and substitution."}

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference."}

Our system employs CRYSTALS-Kyber, a NIST-standardized lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, for quantum-safe key exchange, coupled with AES-256-GCM for efficient authenticated symmetric encryption and SHA-256 for deterministic key derivation. The architecture follows a zero-trust model where a relay server facilitates communication without accessing plaintext messages or cryptographic keys. All encryption and decryption operations occur exclusively at client endpoints. The system demonstrates that NIST standardized post-quantum cryptography can be effectively integrated into practical messaging systems with acceptable performance characteristics, offering protection against both classical and quantum adversaries.

To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., \"get ready for work\") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out \"silent failures\" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal. Experiments demonstrate that V-CAGE yields datasets with superior physical and semantic fidelity, significantly boosting the success rate and generalization of downstream policies compared to non-verified baselines."}

One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts."}

The framework includes four key elements: Delegation Grants (DGs), first-class authorization artefacts that encode revocable transfers of authority with enforced scope reduction; a Canonical Verification Context (CVC) that normalizes verification requests into a single structured representation independent of protocols or credential formats; a layered reference architecture that separates trust anchoring, credential and proof validation, policy evaluation, and protocol mediation via a Trust Gateway; and an explicit treatment of blockchain anchoring as an optional integrity layer rather than a structural dependency.

The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands. This small network runs on the flight controller at 500Hz.

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events."}

Our analysis shows that mempool auditing can result in mis-accusations against miners with a probability larger than 25% in some settings. On a positive note, however, we show that mempool auditing schemes can successfully audit the execution of any two transactions (with an overwhelming probability of 99.9%) if they are consistently received by all observers and sent at least 30 seconds apart from each other.

Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations.

While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly."}

Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area."}

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks.

In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.\n  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles."}

To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches.

To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements.

When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination.

The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds).

We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains."}

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways."}

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines."}

However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning."}

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance."}

The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication.

In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results.

To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets.

Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios.

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines."}

BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies.

Based on the framework, we generalise existing results on FJS to general label spaces and propose a related extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm for class prior probabilities. We also take a fresh look at generalized label shift (GLS) in the case of general label spaces."}

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability."}

Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable."}

Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead."}

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail."}

By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning.

Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings."}

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not only theoretically possible, but also a particular threat to NIDS. In particular, we uncover a practical cyberattack, FPR manipulation attack (FPA), especially targeting industrial IoT networks, where domain-specific knowledge of the widely used MQTT protocol is exploited and a systematic simple packet-level perturbation is performed to alter the labels of benign traffic samples without employing traditional gradient-based or non-gradient-based methods. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel attack results in a success rate of 80.19% to 100%. In addition, while estimating impacts in the Security Operations Center, we observe that even a small fraction of false positive alerts, irrespective of different budget constraints and alert traffic intensities, can increase the delay of genuine alerts investigations up to 2 hr in a single day under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, a series of relevant statistical and XAI analyses is conducted to understand the key factors behind this remarkable success. Finally, we explore the effectiveness of the FPA packets to enhance models' robustness through adversarial training and investigate the changes in decision boundaries accordingly."}

Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric."}

While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly."}

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.\n  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents. These agents synthesize independently gathered evidence from terminal runs and targeted specification queries to reach a final verdict.\n  For historical benchmarks, SmartOracle achieves 0.84 recall with an 18% false positive rate. Compared to a sequential Gemini 2.5 Pro baseline, it improves triage accuracy while reducing analysis time by 4$\\times$ and API costs by 10$\\times$. In active fuzzing campaigns, SmartOracle successfully identified and reported previously unknown specification-level issues across major engines, including bugs in V8, JavaScriptCore, and GraalJS.\n  The success of SmartOracle's agentic architecture on Javascript suggests it might be useful other software systems- a research direction we will explore in future work."}
